## 🔍 Study Overview

This mapping study aimed to investigate how Augmented Reality (AR) has been applied in Software Engineering (SE) education. The study addresses seven research questions concerning:

1. SE subjects explored;
2. AR software used;
3. AR hardware used;
4. Research procedures adopted;
5. Evaluation methods;
6. Reported benefits;
7. Identified challenges.

The goal is to offer a broad overview of current trends, research gaps, and future directions in this emerging field.
