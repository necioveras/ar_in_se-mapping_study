;What do developers want? an advisor approach for developer priorities;Sharma, Vibhu Saujanya and Mehra, Rohit and Kaulgud, Vikrant;;2017;Snowballing backward (XRaSE: towards virtually tangible software using augmented reality);78–81;;On a typical work day, a software developer is swamped to know answers to a multitude of questions to gain diverse insights into the project environment, spanning multiple categories including code, quality and guidance. Due to client mandates, the project environment employs a lot of heterogeneous tools, thus making the relevant information retrieval process fairly complex and therefore it is important to know which insights are most important to the developer. In this paper, we present results from a survey we conducted on a pool of 27 developers from the development team in the delivery center, by asking them to rate a set of 25 Questions, prioritising them as most, moderate and least important to be answered automatically during the software evolution process. We also introduce the concept of Smart Advisor for developers, an intelligence augmentation framework that employs domain and knowledge modelling and in-process analytics to automatically provide important insights and answer developer queries, using a conversational and interactive user interface.;;10.1109/CHASE.2017.14;https://doi.org/10.1109/CHASE.2017.14;;;developer priorities, in-process project insights, smart advisor, software developer survey;IEEE Press;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45464;45464;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Development iterations based on web augmentation and context tasks;Marticorena, Lucy Gutierrez and Morales, Leonardo A. and Antonelli, Leandro and Rossi, Gustavo and Firmenich, Diego;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2022;ACM Digital Library;11793–11817;82;The use of prototypes in requirements engineering has widely known benefits since they actively involve the stakeholders in the development process. Web Augmentation techniques make it possible to build prototypes relying on existing web applications. Thus, high fidelity mockups can be quickly generated. One of the most critical activities is dividing requirements into tasks and managing them through the development process. This paper proposes an approach that includes high fidelity mockups into the Task-oriented Development approach. The proposed approach consists of the following steps: (i) end-users specifies requirements, (ii) a product owner verifies and prioritizes the requirements, (iii) tasks are defined and included in a kanban board, (iv) developers should provide the functionality, and (v) the product owner should approved the functionality. The main contribution of this approach is to integrate the requirements specified through web augmentation mockups, into the development environment via a task-oriented development approach. Thus, developers will have a rich context that facilitates the understanding of the requirements. At the same time, the management of the development process will have benefits because of the traceability between tasks and requirements. This paper describes the approach proposed, called “WAMRI”, and an application of its usage, as well as a tool to support the application.;;10.1007/s11042-022-13694-2;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13694-2;;;Web engineering, Web augmentation, Requirements engineering, Software development environments, Task contexts, Software tools;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Real-time face alignment: evaluation methods, training strategies and implementation optimization;\'{A}lvarez Casado, Constantino and Bordallo L\'{o}pez, Miguel;J. Real-Time Image Process.;2021;ACM Digital Library;2239–2267;18;Face alignment is a crucial component in most face analysis systems. It focuses on identifying the location of several keypoints of the human faces in images or videos. Although several methods and models are available to developers in popular computer vision libraries, they still struggle with challenges such as insufficient illumination, extreme head poses, or occlusions, especially when they are constrained by the needs of real-time applications. Throughout this article, we propose a set of training strategies and implementations based on data augmentation, software optimization techniques that help in improving a large variety of models belonging to several real-time algorithms for face alignment. We propose an extended set of evaluation metrics that allow novel evaluations to mitigate the typical problems found in real-time tracking contexts. The experimental results show that the generated models using our proposed techniques are faster, smaller, more accurate, more robust in specific challenging conditions and smoother in tracking systems. In addition, the training strategy shows to be applicable across different types of devices and algorithms, making them versatile in both academic and industrial uses.;;10.1007/s11554-021-01107-w;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11554-021-01107-w;;;Face alignment, Real-time, Embedded devices, Cascaded regression, Optimization implementation, Training strategies;Springer-Verlag;1861-8200;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;On the Popularity of Internet of Things Projects in Online Communities: An Empirical Study of Hackster.io;Ghaleb, Taher Ahmed and da Costa, Daniel Alencar and Zou, Ying;Information Systems Frontiers;2022;ACM Digital Library;1601–1634;24;Online Internet of Things (IoT) communities allow IoT engineers to publish information about their projects to a wider audience of users. Despite the growing adoption of IoT technologies in business, the popularity of IoT projects remains unexplored. Understanding how to improve the popularity of IoT projects helps project owners attract more users and foster business opportunities. In this paper, we explore the important characteristics of popular IoT projects across three facets: views count, respects count, and trending scores. We study over 18,000 IoT projects hosted on Hackster.io—a large online IoT community. In particular, we perform a time-series clustering to identify the evolution of each of the three popularity facets. In addition, we construct linear mixed-effect models to investigate the most important factors associated with the popularity of IoT projects. We provide insights to online IoT communities to improve the user guidelines to help (new) IoT engineers make their projects more eye-catching.;;10.1007/s10796-021-10157-1;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-021-10157-1;;;Online communities, Popularity, Internet of Things (IoT), Empirical study;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1387-3326;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Theoretically-Defined vs. User-Defined Squeeze Gestures;"Villarreal-Narvaez, Santiago and Slu\""{y}ters, Arthur and Vanderdonckt, Jean and Mbaki Luzayisu, Efrem";Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;6;This paper presents theoretical and empirical results about user-defined gesture preferences for squeezable objects by focusing on a particular object: a deformable cushion. We start with a theoretical analysis of potential gestures for this squeezable object by defining a multi-dimension taxonomy of squeeze gestures composed of 82 gesture classes. We then empirically analyze the results of a gesture elicitation study resulting in a set of N=32 participants X 21 referents = 672 elicited gestures, further classified into 26 gesture classes. We also contribute to the practice of gesture elicitation studies by explaining why we started from a theoretical analysis (by systematically exploring a design space of potential squeeze gestures) to end up with an empirical analysis (by conducting a gesture elicitation study afterward): the intersection of the results from these sources confirm or disconfirm consensus gestures. Based on these findings, we extract from the taxonomy a subset of recommended gestures that give rise to design implications for gesture interaction with squeezable objects.;;10.1145/3567805;https://doi.org/10.1145/3567805;;;Deformable User Interfaces, Design Guidelines, Gesture Elicitation Study, Gesture User Interfaces, Shape-Changing Interfaces, Squeezable object, Wearable computing;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A case study on the use of a conceptual modeling framework for construction simulation;Abdelmegid, Mohammed Adel and O’Sullivan, Michael and Gonz\'{a}lez, Vicente A and Walker, Cameron G and Poshdar, Mani;Simulation;2022;ACM Digital Library;433–460;98;Construction simulation has been an active area of research in the last six decades. Nevertheless, there has been a gap between academia and industry in realizing the capabilities of simulation to support decision-making in construction. One of the well-recognized reasons is the difficulty of undertaking comprehensive simulation studies by construction practitioners, who usually lack sufficient knowledge and skills to adequately build simulation models. Efforts to bridge this gap have been focused on simplifying the computer coding and model implementation stages of construction simulation studies with limited research on the early stage of defining the model and abstracting the system, i.e., conceptual modeling. The conceptual modeling stage is known to be one of the most difficult tasks in a simulation study. Thus, several frameworks to support building conceptual models have been proposed in simulation literature. This study contributes to the research efforts to promote simulation in the construction industry through the adoption of a conceptual modeling framework. It demonstrates the application of the proposed conceptual modeling framework in a case study of piling operations. The findings of this paper reinforced the significance of conceptual modeling by confirming the role of the conceptual model as a communication link between stakeholders. Moreover, the conceptual model was used as a specification document for developing a flexible model that can be replicated in other settings. The use of a documented conceptual model assisted in managing the overall simulation study efficiently, which, in turn, lead to reductions in time and effort for different modeling activities.;;10.1177/00375497211056087;https://doi.org/10.1177/00375497211056087;;;Construction simulation, piling, conceptual modeling;Society for Computer Simulation International;0037-5497;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;EcoVis: visual analysis of industrial-level spatio-temporal correlations in electricity consumption;Xiao, Yong and Zheng, Kaihong and Lonapalawong, Supaporn and Lu, Wenjie and Chen, Zexian and Qian, Bin and Zhang, Tianye and Wang, Xin and Chen, Wei;Front. Comput. Sci.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;16;Closely related to the economy, the analysis and management of electricity consumption has been widely studied. Conventional approaches mainly focus on the prediction and anomaly detection of electricity consumption, which fails to reveal the in-depth relationships between electricity consumption and various factors such as industry, weather etc.. In the meantime, the lack of analysis tools has increased the difficulty in analytical tasks such as correlation analysis and comparative analysis. In this paper, we introduce EcoVis, a visual analysis system that supports the industrial-level spatio-temporal correlation analysis in the electricity consumption data. We not only propose a novel approach to model spatio-temporal data into a graph structure for easier correlation analysis, but also introduce a novel visual representation to display the distributions of multiple instances in a single map. We implement the system with the cooperation with domain experts. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.;;10.1007/s11704-020-0088-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11704-020-0088-8;;;spatio-temporal data, electricity consumption, correlation analysis, visual analysis, visualization;Springer-Verlag;2095-2228;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Reverse Traceability Framework for Identifying Liability of Crashes for Self-Driving Vehicles Using Blockchains;Gupta, Samar and Verma, Jitendra Kumar;J. Glob. Inf. Manage.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1–21;31;Modern vehicles are increasingly having a higher level of technology and automation. Humans are increasingly becoming dependent on these modern technologies to take decisions related to their lives and safety. Such an increasing dependence on automation raises an important question. If an autonomous vehicle (AV) meets an accident, who will be responsible? It is not the human driver, but technology that makes those crucial decisions on the road. This question is attracting considerable attention in the insurance industry because traditional vehicle insurance is based on the liability of human drivers, but in the future, vehicle technology will replace human drivers. Therefore, the vehicle manufacturer or one of its suppliers may be held responsible for the accident. This paper presents a crash liability identification framework that can identify who is liable if there is a crash or an accident of an autonomous self-driving vehicle. The use cases demonstrate that the proposed framework can be used by regulators to efficiently identify the liable party when an AV crashes.;;10.4018/JGIM.329961;https://doi.org/10.4018/JGIM.329961;;;Automotive Sectors, Autonomous Vehicles, Liability Framework, Reverse Traceability, Self-Driving Vehicles, Supply Chain Management;IGI Global;1062-7375;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Circa: collaborative code offloading among multiple mobile devices;Lin, Xueling and Jiang, Jingjie and Li, Calvin Hong Yi and Li, Bo and Li, Baochun;Wirel. Netw.;2020;ACM Digital Library;823–841;26;"For mobile users who seek extra power or computing resources to perform computation-intensive tasks, code offloading to remote infrastructures is a promising solution. However, most of the recent works mainly target on code offloading from single mobile devices to remote cloud servers, which restricts the potential of offloading only to devices with available Internet access. Moreover, offloading to remote cloud computing platforms is not always guaranteed to be time efficient and energy conserving. In this paper, we propose Circa, a framework that demonstrates the feasibility of code offloading among multiple mobile devices in the same vicinity, leveraging the presence of iBeacons. Circa eliminates the costs incurred by connecting to a remote cloud and running virtual machine instances in the cloud. With iBeacons, neighbouring devices can discover and support one another through collaborative code offloading with short-range communication, obviating the need for centralized servers
. We also propose task allocation algorithms to select reliable collaborators among nearby mobile devices and disseminate the computation intensive tasks among them efficiently in a fair fashion. The performance of the task allocation algorithm is evaluated based on three different mobility models. We also implement a prototype of the Circa framework on an iOS platform and validate its feasibility and efficiency using iOS devices
. According to the experimental results, by involving nearby mobile devices as collaborators, Circa is able to reduce the total execution time of an offloaded task substantially, while preserving the satisfactory performance of mobile applications

;A Survey on UAV-Enabled Edge Computing: Resource Management Perspective;Xia, Xiaoyu and Fattah, Sheik Mohammad Mostakim and Babar, Muhammad Ali;ACM Comput. Surv.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;56;Edge computing facilitates low-latency services at the network’s edge by distributing computation, communication, and storage resources within the geographic proximity of mobile and Internet-of-Things devices. The recent advancement in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies has opened new opportunities for edge computing in military operations, disaster response, or remote areas where traditional terrestrial networks are limited or unavailable. In such environments, UAVs can be deployed as aerial edge servers or relays to facilitate edge computing services. This form of computing is also known as UAV-enabled Edge Computing (UEC), which offers several unique benefits such as mobility, line-of-sight, flexibility, computational capability, and cost-efficiency. However, the resources on UAVs, edge servers, and Internet-of-Things devices are typically very limited in the context of UEC. Efficient resource management is therefore a critical research challenge in UEC. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research in UEC from the resource management perspective. We identify a conceptual architecture, different types of collaborations, wireless communication models, research directions, key techniques, and performance indicators for resource management in UEC. We also present a taxonomy of resource management in UEC. Finally, we identify and discuss some open research challenges that can stimulate future research directions for resource management in UEC.;;10.1145/3626566;https://doi.org/10.1145/3626566;;;UAV-enabled edge computing, resource management, architectures, offloading, allocation, provisioning, algorithms;Association for Computing Machinery;0360-0300;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Federated learning for 5G and beyond, a blessing and a curse- an experimental study on intrusion detection systems;Taki Eddine Toufik Djaidja and Bouziane Brik and Abdelwahab Boualouache and Sidi Mohammed Senouci and Yacine Ghamri-Doudane;Computers & Security;2024;Science@Direct;103707;139;5G's service providers now leverage Deep Learning (DL) to automate their network slice management, provisioning, and security. To this end, each slice owner contributes data to feed a common dataset used to train centralized learning models. However, this method raises privacy considerations that prevent its usage. Therefore, Federated learning (FL), a collaborative approach that ensures data privacy, is being investigated while striving toward the same performance as centralized learning. As 5G and beyond services are so diverse, the local slice's data is not intended to reflect the entire data distribution. Thus, local data of slices are Non-Independently and non-Identically distributed (Non-IID), posing a challenge for FL-based models. In this paper, we investigate the use of FL to secure network slices and detect potential attacks. For that purpose, we first propose an architecture for deploying intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in 5G and beyond networks. Next, we thoroughly evaluate the latest state-of-art FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedPer, and SCAFFOLD, in the context of Independently and Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-IID data distributions. We compare these FL models to centralized and local DL models. We find that SCAFFOLD outperforms all the other FL algorithms and ensures a stable learning loss convergence, a promising finding that strengthens the case for leveraging FL in IDS development. Nevertheless, none of the FL models could achieve the centralized model's performance in Non-IID scenarios.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2024.103707;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404824000087;;;Federated learning, Deep learning, IDS, NON-IID, 5G and beyond;;0167-4048;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Engineering the Transition of Interactive Collaborative Software from Cloud Computing to Edge Computing;Ortegat, Guillaume and Grolaux, Donatien and Riviere, Etienne and Vanderdonckt, Jean;Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;6;"The ""Software as a Service"" (SaaS) model of cloud computing popularized online multiuser collaborative software. Two famous examples of this class of software are Office 365 from Microsoft and Google Workspace. Cloud technology removes the need to install and update the software on end users' computers and provides the necessary underlying infrastructure for online collaboration. However, to provide a good end-user experience, cloud services require an infrastructure able to scale up to the task and allow low-latency interactions with a variety of users worldwide. This is a limiting factor for actors that do not possess such infrastructure. Unlike cloud computing which forgets the computational and interactional capabilities of end users' devices, the edge computing paradigm promises to exploit them as much as possible. To investigate the potential of edge computing over cloud computing, this paper presents a method for engineering interactive collaborative software supported by edge devices for the replacement of cloud computing resources. Our method is able to handle user interface aspects such as connection, execution, migration, and disconnection differently depending on the available technology. We exemplify our approach by developing a distributed Pictionary game deployed in two scenarios: a nonshared scenario where each participant interacts only with their own device and a shared scenario where participants also share a common device, including a TV. After a theoretical comparative study of edge vs. cloud computing, an experiment compares the two implementations to determine their effect on the end user's perceived experience and latency vs. real latency.";;10.1145/3532210;https://doi.org/10.1145/3532210;;;cloud computing, distributed user interfaces, edge computing, peer-to-peer computing, perceived latency, system latency, traffic control, user interface migration;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This systematic review attempts to address eleven specific research questions related to the learing skills, participants, AR technology, research design, data collection methods, settings, evaluation parameters, intervention outcomes, generalization, and maintenance. The social communication skill was the highly targeted skill, and individuals with ASD were part of all the studies. Computer, smartphone, and smartglass are more frequently used technologies. The commonly used research design was pre-test and post-test. Almost all the studies used observation as a data collection method, and classroom environment or controlled research environment were used as a setting of evaluation. Most of the evaluation parameters were human-assisted. The results of the studies show that AR benefited children with ASD in learning skills. The generalization test was conducted in one study only, but the results were not reported. The results of maintenance tests conducted in five studies during a short-term period following the withdrawal of intervention were positive. Although the effect of using AR towards the learning of individuals was positive, given the wide variety of skills targeted in the studies, and the heterogeneity of the participants, a summative conclusion regarding the effectiveness of AR for teaching or learning of skills related to ASD based on the existing literature is not possible. The review also proposes the research taxonomy for ASD. Future research addressing the effectiveness of AR among more participants, different technologies supporting AR for the intervention, generalization, and maintenance of learning skills, and the evaluation in the inslusive classroom environment and other settings is warranted.;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986608;;;;"Databases;Augmented reality;Autism;Maintenance engineering;Systematics;Data collection;Augmented reality;autism spectrum disorder;computer;data collection;intervention;mixed reality;research design;smartglass;smartphone;social communication;tablet;technology;virtual reality;inclusive education";;2169-3536;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Real-Time 3D Hand-Object Pose Estimation for Mobile Devices;Yin, Yue and McCarthy, Chris and Rezazadegan, Dana;;2021;IEEE Digital Library;3288-3292;;Interest in 3D hand pose estimation is rapidly growing, offering the potential for real-time hand gesture recognition in a range of interactive VR/AR applications, and beyond. Most current 3D hand pose estimation models rely on dedicated depth-sensing cameras and/or specialised hardware support to handle both the high computation and memory requirements. However, such requirements hinder the practical application of such models on mobile devices or in other embedded computing contexts. To address this, we propose a lightweight model for hand and object pose estimation specifically targeting mobile applications. Using RGB images only, we show how our approach achieves real-time performance, comparable accuracy, and an 81% model size reduction compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby supporting the feasibility of the model for deployment on mobile platforms.;;10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506135;;;;"Performance evaluation;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Image recognition;Computational modeling;Pose estimation;Memory management;3D hand pose estimation;mobile computing;gesture recognition;virtual reality;augmented reality";;2381-8549;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Towards the Systematic Testing of Virtual Reality Programs;Andrade, Stevão A. and Nunes, Fatima L. S. and Delamaro, Marcio E.;;2019;IEEE Digital Library;196-205;;Background: Software testing is a critical activity to ensure that software complies with its specification. However, current software testing activities tend not to be completely effective when applied in specific software domains in Virtual Reality (VR) that has several new types of features such as images, sounds, videos, and differentiated interaction, which can become sources of new kinds of faults. Aims: This paper presents an overview of the main VR characteristics that can have an impact on verification, validation, and testing (VV&T). Furthermore, it analyzes some of the most successful VR open-source projects to draw a picture concerning the danger of the lack of software testing activities. Method: We compared the current state of software testing practice in open-source VR projects and evaluate how the lack of testing can be damaging to the development of a product. We assessed the incidence of code smells and verified how such projects behave concerning the tendency to present faults. We also perform the same analyses on projects that are not VR related to have a better understanding of these results. Results: The results showed that the practice of software testing is not yet widespread in the development of VR applications. It was also found that there is a high incidence of code smells in VR projects. Analyzing Non-VR projects we noticed that classes that have test cases tend to produce fewer smells compared to classes that were not tested. Regarding fault-proneness analysis, we used an unsupervised approach to VR and Non-VR projects. Results showed that about 12.2% of the classes analyzed in VR projects are fault-prone, while Non-VR projects presented a lower fault-proneness rate (8.9%). Conclusions: Regarding the application of software testing techniques on VR projects, it was observed that only a small number of projects are concerned about developing test cases for VR projects, perhaps because we still do not have the necessary tools to help in this direction. Concerning smells, we concluded that there is a high incidence in VR projects, especially regarding implementing smells and this high incidence can have a significant influence on faults. Finally, the study related to fault proneness pointed out that the lack of software testing activity is a significant risk to the success of the projects.;;10.1109/SVR.2019.00044;;;;"Software testing;Open source software;Measurement;Tools;Virtual reality;software testing, virtual reality, validation, code smells, fault proneness";;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;MLOps in the Metaverse: Human-Centric Continuous Integration;Su, Ningxin and Li, Baochun;IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications;2023;IEEE Digital Library;1-1;;The metaverse is a virtual world that exists entirely in a computer-generated environment, and it offers a new frontier for machine learning. One of the major challenges for using machine learning in the metaverse is MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), an emerging field that focuses on deploying and managing machine learning models in production. It has been widely acknowledged that machine learning models require a large amount of data to learn and make accurate predictions, and such data is generated progressively in real-time as human users interact with the metaverse. Due to the human-centric nature of the metaverse, it goes without saying that, once deployed, models need to be able to adapt to the constantly changing interactive environment and still make accurate predictions. Borrowing a page from software engineering, in this paper, we explore the design space of human-centric continuous integration in metaverse environments, where labeled data samples accumulated with explicit human interactive behavior (e.g., using virtual reality or augmented reality headsets) are used for fine-tuning a deployed deep learning model over a sustained period of time. We propose SPIN, a new mechanism that efficiently utilizes data samples collected from a large number of participating human users over time to fine-tune a deployed model that is shared across all the users. In an extensive array of experimental results using image classification and state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection models as case studies, we show that SPIN outperforms FedBuff, a state-of-the-art asynchronous FL mechanism from conventional federated learning, by a substantial margin.;;10.1109/JSAC.2023.3345385;;;;"Metaverse;Data models;Machine learning;Servers;Task analysis;Behavioral sciences;Adaptation models;Continuous integration;MLOps;federated learning;metaverse";;1558-0008;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Collaborative Software Visualization for Program Comprehension;Krause-Glau, Alexander and Bader, Marcel and Hasselbring, Wilhelm;;2022;IEEE Digital Library;75-86;;In the context of program comprehension, learning and working in teams, e.g., via pair programming, shared documentation, and discussions, can facilitate the comprehension tasks. So far, team collaboration is a relatively unexplored aspect in software visualizations, in particular approaches which are designed and explored to enable collaborative program comprehension.In this paper, we introduce our collaboratively usable software visualization environment for program comprehension. Related approaches are often limited to single-user modes, therefore neglect the advantages of multi-user collaboration, or allow only the use of a single type of device. Our approach addresses this topic and allows users to collaboratively explore software visualizations in a device-heterogeneous environment. User events, e.g., sharable pop-up information windows, are synchronized between each session participant, regardless of the employed device.To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first approaches that combines on-screen, virtual reality, and augmented reality modes in a single web-based SV tool for program comprehension. We conducted a user study to collect initial results regarding the perceived usefulness and enjoyment of co-explored software cities In that study, 20 participants collaboratively solved program comprehension tasks while using each mode consecutively. The results indicate that the majority of participants find our approach useful and enjoyable, with AR being the least favored mode. We provide each participant’s video recording, the study’s raw results, Jupyter Notebooks, and all steps to reproduce our evaluation as supplementary package. Furthermore, a live demo of our tool is available online.1 We invite other researchers to extend our open-source software and jointly research this novel approach.Video URL: https://youtu.be/MYAkRMWLVD8;;10.1109/VISSOFT55257.2022.00016;;;;"Uniform resource locators;Knowledge engineering;Visualization;Urban areas;Collaboration;Documentation;Synchronization;program comprehension;software visualization;collaboration;software as a service;extended reality";;2832-6555;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

planning, analysis, design, implementation and maintenance. Then after
the application has been built, does it finish there? As we know
software always grows and develops according to human needs. Therefore,
there are continuous stages that must be patterned so that the life

;Comparison of 3D 360-Degree Video Compression Performance Using Different Projections;Jamali, Mohammadreza and Golaghazadeh, Firouzeh and Coulombe, Stéphane and Vakili, Ahmad and Vazquez, Carlos;;2019;IEEE Digital Library;1-6;;3D and multi-view 360-degree videos offer 3D immersive visual experience of the real world on head-mounted displays (HMDs). They are used in extended reality applications (including virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality) such as gaming, entertainment, education and medicine. However, these applications require a very high rate of compression and a great deal of computational resources. Compression efficiency and coding complexity are highly influenced by 360 projections used to map spherical frames to rectangular frames. To study the effect of this mapping process, in this paper, we evaluate the performance of various projections in 3D and multi-view 360-degree videos in terms of coding efficiency, quality and complexity. The evaluation is conducted for two coding scenarios: stereo coding scenario where the encoder considers the interview dependency for disparity estimation and simulcast coding scenario where two views are encoded separately. This performance evaluation approach provides valuable insights on using 360-degree projections in 3D and multi-view coding.;;10.1109/CCECE.2019.8861868;;;;"Encoding;Three-dimensional displays;PSNR;Software engineering;Performance evaluation;Video coding;360-degree video;projection;3D video;multi-view video;performance evaluation";;2576-7046;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;IDEvelopAR: A Programming Interface to enhance Code Understanding in Augmented Reality;Kreber, Lucas and Diehl, Stephan and Weil, Patrick;;2022;IEEE Digital Library;87-95;;During software maintenance developers spend a considerable amount of time on tasks like navigating, identifying required code locations or tracing various call hierarchies. The classical tabbed interfaces, as found in modern IDEs, are not ideal for such tasks, leading to an inefficient workflow containing many context switches. Therefore, several programming environments, like Code Bubbles, were proposed to overcome these issues by allowing users to freely arrange code fragments on a canvas to make relations more explicit and better understand the codebase. Relations are made explicit using visual links or extra space between groups of code fragments. As a consequence, these approach quickly run out of screen space. In this paper, we present IDEVELOPAR, a tool to enhance code understanding in augmented reality. Due to the use of AR, a user is not restricted anymore by limited display sizes and can use the entire physical space as a workspace for placing and grouping code fragments as well as making changes to the codebase. First, we introduce the views and interactive functionalities of our tool. Next, we illustrate the usefulness of the tool by navigating an example program to locate and fix a bug. Finally, we briefly discuss the results of a cognitive walk-through using the cognitive dimension framework as well as a formative user study to identify potential usability problems.

emphasizing the teachers' needs for familiarization with the new
technological conditions. A transmedia integration approach is deployed

software engineering kind of framework. The topic is inspired by social
studies and humanities, which seem to be marginalized, usually failing
to make effective technological facilities, benefits, and contemporary
findings. It is, therefore, necessary to modernize the approach to
literary things and integrate digital means into the educational
process, even in cases where a sole educator on humanities and social
studies lacks multidisciplinary support in multimedia authoring and
software engineering. This modernization can be made possible by
introducing user-friendly tools into the process, representing not just
a fashion of the time but mostly a renewal trend, aiming at revitalizing
the course to attract and engage learners. Undoubtedly, today's pupils
have grown up with technological means, becoming familiar with their use
so their implication causes undiminished interest in most daily
activities, including schooling. In this high-tech generation, it is
absurd to address the transmission of knowledge and values in outdated
ways. Apart from adapting to the timely students' needs, lesson plans on
transmedia storytelling practices can also satisfy tutors, triggering
their inspiration and co-creation potentials. Overall, the project aims
to attract the trainees' interest with the help of digital tools, which
will be embodied in the educational processes by teachers without

The aim of this scoping review was to give an overview of the usability and feasibility of smart glasses in nursing education. In addition, this study will highlight nursing students’ experiences of using smart glasses in learning situations.
Background
Healthcare is becoming increasingly complex and technological and so is nursing education. Technology enhanced learning aims to enhance the teaching-learning process through use of technology, for example through smart glasses.
Design and methods
A literature review using a scoping review methodology was conducted. Qualitative content analysis was performed to analyse data. 14 references were included in the analysis. References were found using the databases PubMed, SCOPUS and ERIC.
Results
The analysis resulted in three categories; (1) Situations in which smart glasses have been used in nursing education, (2) Learning experiences from using smart glasses in nursing education, and (3) User experiences from using smart glasses in nursing education. Smart glasses were used in different learning situations and were in general positively evaluated by nursing students. Although, drawbacks of using smart glasses were noted which could negatively effect student learning.
Conclusions
Smart glasses have been used in a variety of learning situations in nursing education and enabled new learning situations. Students found smart glasses beneficial for their learning and smart glasses motivated and engaged students in the learning situation. Although, this was both user- and situation dependent. Technical issues could cause students to lose focus and there is need for technical support to facilitate the learning curve.

;Visualization and ecohydrologic models: Opening the box;Tague, Christina and Frew, James;HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES;2021;ISI Web of Science;;35;"Earth system models synthesize the science of interactions amongst
multiple biophysical and, increasingly, human processes across a wide
range of scales. Ecohydrologic models are a subset of earth system
models that focus particularly on the complex interactions between
ecosystem processes and the storage and flux of water. Ecohydrologic
models often focus at scales where direct observations occur: plots,
hillslopes, streams, and watersheds, as well as where land and resource
management decisions are implemented. These models complement
field-based and data-driven science by combining theory, empirical
relationships derived from observation and new data to create virtual
laboratories. Ecohydrologic models are tools that managers can use to
ask ``what if{''} questions and domain scientists can use to explore the
implications of new theory or measurements. Recent decades have seen
substantial advances in ecohydrologic models, building on both new
domain science and advances in software engineering and data
availability. The increasing sophistication of ecohydrologic models
however, presents a barrier to their widespread use and credibility.
Their complexity, often encoding 100s of relationships, means that they
are effectively ``black boxes,{''} at least for most users, sometimes
even to the teams of researchers that contribute to their design. This
opacity complicates the interpretation of model results. For models to
effectively advance our understanding of how plants and water interact,
we must improve how we visualize not only model outputs, but also the
underlying theories that are encoded within the models. In this paper,
we outline a framework for increasing the usefulness of ecohydrologic
models through better visualization. We outline four complementary
approaches, ranging from simple best practices that leverage existing
technologies, to ideas that would engage novel software engineering and
cutting edge human-computer interface design. Our goal is to open the
ecohydrologic model black box in ways that will engage multiple
audiences, from novices to model developers, and support learning, new
discovery, and environmental problem solving.";;10.1002/hyp.13991;;;;;;0885-6087;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Three different objectives that must fit together to create an efficient Virtual Reality (VR) learning experience were found: relevant information content, learning design, and technical feasibility. To achieve these multidisciplinary goals, a simple framework for designing VR learning materials was created. A 360-VR version of a chemistry laboratory exercise was designed and created following this framework. Data on its effectiveness was collected on a laboratory course with over 150 first-year chemical engineering students. The students completed the same laboratory exercise both as a virtual laboratory and in a real student laboratory. In the student feedback, students clearly stated that virtual laboratories cannot replace the experience in a real laboratory, and that the virtual laboratory exercises did not directly increase student motivation. Nevertheless, students showed a very positive attitude towards virtual learning materials and suggested including even more activating materials such as quizzes and interactive videos in the learning materials. Only a few students reported any downsides related to the virtual laboratory exercise. Overall, it was shown that our design principles work in practice as the students reported several real benefits when they completed a virtual laboratory exercise before the real-life laboratory exercise. These benefits included learning the correct way that the laboratory exercise proceeds and how to perform certain tasks correctly.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ece.2023.06.004;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1749772823000295;;;Chemistry laboratory education, Virtual reality, Virtual laboratory exercise, 360 environment, student engagement;;1749-7728;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Overcoming challenges when teaching hands-on courses about Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality: Methods, techniques and best practice;Ralf Doerner and Robin Horst;Graphics and Visual Computing;2022;Science@Direct;200037;6;This paper presents methods and techniques for teaching Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) that were conceived and refined during more than 20 years of our teaching experience on these subjects in higher education. We cover a broad spectrum from acquainting learners with VR and AR as only one aspect of a more general course to an in-depth course on VR and AR during a whole semester. The focus of the paper is methods and techniques that allow learners to not only learn about VR and AR on a theoretical level but that facilitate their own VR and AR experiences with all senses and foster hands-on learning. We show why this is challenging (e.g., the high workload involved with the preparation of hands-on experiences, the large amount of course time that needs to be devoted), and how these challenges can be met (e.g., using our Circuit Parcours Technique). Moreover, we discuss learning goals that can be addressed in VR and AR courses besides hands-on experiences when using our methods and techniques. Finally, we provide best practice examples that can be used as blueprints for parts of a VR and AR course.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gvc.2021.200037;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666629421000188;;;Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Teaching techniques;;2666-6294;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A case study for risk assessment in AR-equipped socio-technical systems;Soheila {Sheikh Bahaei} and Barbara Gallina and Marko Vidović;Journal of Systems Architecture;2021;Science@Direct;102250;119;Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are used as human–machine interface within various types of safety-critical systems. Several studies have shown that AR improves human performance. However, the introduction of AR might introduce risks due to new types of dependability threats. In order to avoid unreasonable risk, it is required to detect new types of dependability threats (faults, errors, failures). In our previous work, we have designed extensions for the SafeConcert metamodel (a metamodel for modeling socio-technical systems) to capture AR-related dependability threats (focusing on faults and failures). Despite the availability of various modeling techniques, there has been no detailed investigation of providing an integrated framework for risk assessment in AR-equipped socio-technical systems. Hence, in this paper, we provide an integrated framework based on our previously proposed extensions. In addition, in cooperation with our industrial partners, active in the automotive domain, we design and execute a case study. We aim at verifying the modeling and analysis capabilities of our framework and finding out if the proposed extensions are helpful in capturing system risks caused by new AR-related dependability threats. Our conducted qualitative analysis is based on the Concerto-FLA analysis technique, which is included in the CHESS toolset and targets socio-technical systems.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2021.102250;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762121001715;;;Socio-technical systems, Augmented reality, Risk assessment, ISO 26262, ISO/PAS 21448-SOTIF;;1383-7621;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Security computing resource allocation based on deep reinforcement learning in serverless multi-cloud edge computing;Hang Zhang and Jinsong Wang and Hongwei Zhang and Chao Bu;Future Generation Computer Systems;2024;Science@Direct;152-161;151;Handling computationally intensive tasks is challenging for user devices (UDs) with limited computing resources. Serverless cloud edge computing solves this problem and reduces maintenance and management. Its crucial function is to allocate computing resources reasonably. However, linking multiple computing resource nodes to perform computing resource allocation and ensure data security is a significant challenge. This study proposes an approach based on action-constrained deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to allocate computing resources securely. First, we consider a model of a serverless multi-cloud edge computing network with multiple computing resource nodes that possess various attribute characteristics. Then, we design a security mechanism to guarantee data security. Afterward, we formalize the network model and objectives and further transform them into a modeling process known as the Markov decision process. Finally, we propose DRL based on action constraints to provide an optimal resource allocation scheduling policy. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can reduce system costs and improve working performance compared with the comparison schemes.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2023.09.016;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X23003461;;;Serverless cloud edge computing, Resource allocation, Deep reinforcement learning;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A comparative study on online machine learning techniques for network traffic streams analysis;Amin Shahraki and Mahmoud Abbasi and Amir Taherkordi and Anca Delia Jurcut;Computer Networks;2022;Science@Direct;108836;207;Modern networks generate a massive amount of traffic data streams. Analyzing this data is essential for various purposes, such as network resources management and cyber-security analysis. There is an urgent need for data analytic methods that can perform network data processing in an online manner based on the arrival of new data. Online machine learning (OL) techniques promise to support such type of data analytics. In this paper, we investigate and compare the OL techniques that facilitate data stream analytics in the networking domain. We also investigate the importance of traffic data analytics and highlight the advantages of online learning in this regard, as well as the challenges associated with OL-based network traffic stream analysis, e.g., concept drift and the imbalanced classes. We review the data stream processing tools and frameworks that can be used to process such data online or on-the-fly along with their pros and cons, and their integrability with de facto data processing frameworks. To explore the performance of OL techniques, we conduct an empirical evaluation on the performance of different ensemble- and tree-based algorithms for network traffic classification. Finally, the open issues and the future directions in analyzing traffic data streams are presented. This technical study presents valuable insights and outlook for the network research community when dealing with the requirements and purposes of online data streams analytics and learning in the networking domain.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2022.108836;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128622000512;;;Machine learning, Online learning, Network traffic streams, Network traffic classification, Internet of Things, Deep Learning;;1389-1286;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A critical analysis of image-based camera pose estimation techniques;Meng Xu and Youchen Wang and Bin Xu and Jun Zhang and Jian Ren and Zhao Huang and Stefan Poslad and Pengfei Xu;Neurocomputing;2024;Science@Direct;127125;570;Camera, and associated with its objects within the field of view, localization could benefit many computer vision fields, such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, and augmented reality (AR). After decades of progress, camera localization, also called camera pose estimation could compute the 6DoF pose of objects for a camera in a given image, with respect to different images in a sequence or formats. Structure feature-based localization methods have achieved great success when integrated with image matching or with a coordinate regression stage. Absolute and relative pose regression methods using transfer learning can support end-to-end localization to directly regress a camera pose but achieve a less accurate performance. Despite the rapid development of multiple branches in this area, a comprehensive, in-depth and comparative analysis is lacking to summarize, classify and compare, structure feature-based and regression-based camera localization methods. Existing surveys either focus on larger SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems or on only part of the camera localization method, lack detailed comparisons and descriptions of the methods or datasets used, neural network designs such as loss designs, and input formats, etc. In this survey, we first introduce specific application areas and the evaluation metrics for camera localization pose according to different sub-tasks (learning-based 2D-2D task, 2D-3D task, and 3D-3D task). Then, we review common methods for structure feature-based camera pose estimation approaches, absolute pose regression and relative pose regression approaches by critically modelling the methods to inspire further improvements in their algorithms such as loss functions, and neural network structures. Furthermore, we summarize what are the popular datasets used for camera localization and compare the quantitative and qualitative results of these methods with detailed performance metrics. Finally, we discuss future research possibilities and applications.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2023.127125;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231223012481;;;Camera pose regression, Structure feature-based localization, Absolute pose regression, Relative pose regression;;0925-2312;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A systematic review of immersive virtual reality applications for higher education: Design elements, lessons learned, and research agenda;Jaziar Radianti and Tim A. Majchrzak and Jennifer Fromm and Isabell Wohlgenannt;Computers & Education;2020;Science@Direct;103778;147;Researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (VR) in different scenarios. VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103778;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131519303276;;;Augmented and virtual reality, Cooperative/collaborative learning, Distance education and online learning, Human–computer interface, Media in education;;0360-1315;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Design of a reference architecture for developing smart warehouses in industry 4.0;Maarten {van Geest} and Bedir Tekinerdogan and Cagatay Catal;Computers in Industry;2021;Science@Direct;103343;124;Smart warehousing aims at increasing the overall service quality, productivity, and efficiency while minimizing the costs and failures. For designing the reference architecture, we apply a domain-driven architecture design approach and use the architecture design knowledge as presented in the software architecture design literature. We first provide the results of a thorough domain analysis process to smart warehouses to identify the key concerns that shape the architecture of smart warehouses. The domain model is presented using feature diagrams that show the common and variant features of smart warehouses. The domain analysis process is followed by the architecture design process, whereby we have used architecture viewpoints for modeling the reference architecture. Different businesses require different kinds of smart warehouses. Therefore, we present the generic business process model for both traditional warehouses and smart warehouses. The business modeling process is followed by the architecture design process, whereby we have used architecture viewpoints for modeling the reference architecture. Once the reference architecture is designed, a case study has been used to evaluate the proposed reference architecture.

;A knowledge management system for sharing knowledge about cultural heritage projects;Néstor A. Nova and Rafael A. González and Lina C. Beltrán and Carlos E. Nieto;Journal of Cultural Heritage;2023;Science@Direct;61-70;63;Cultural Heritage Projects (CHP) are complex activities that involve multiple and heterogeneous actors attempting to harmonize their different and diverse ontological and epistemological perspectives, while simultaneously coordinating and sharing knowledge about heritage objects. Projects involve a multitude of related data, information, and knowledge, and require information technologies for coordination. In this context, the socio-technical approach to designing information systems (IS) has become widely adopted but it is contradictory in knowledge coordination scenarios in which heritage experts and coordination technologies form inseparable sociomaterial assemblages that evolve through routines and affordances, depending on the contextual dimensions of particular projects. This paper adopts a design science approach to present the sociomaterial design of a Knowledge Management System (KMS) for cultural heritage projects. The KMS aims to overcome coordination issues for sharing knowledge within and between heritage projects. Evaluation results outline that the KMS provides enhanced knowledge access and visualization, greater flexibility in sharing practices, and improved decision-making capabilities. The designed system meets the specific requirements of an international knowledge sharing network and introduces innovative design and coordination insights that can be successfully deployed in heritage projects and networks with similar coordination and collaborative features.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.culher.2023.07.013;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207423001358;;;Cultural heritage, Knowledge management system, Knowledge sharing, Coordination, Sociomateriality, Design science;;1296-2074;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A survey on the computation offloading approaches in mobile edge computing: A machine learning-based perspective;Ali Shakarami and Mostafa Ghobaei-Arani and Ali Shahidinejad;Computer Networks;2020;Science@Direct;107496;182;With the rapid developments in emerging mobile technologies, utilizing resource-hungry mobile applications such as media processing, online Gaming, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) play an essential role in both businesses and entertainments. To soften the burden of such complexities incurred by fast developments of such serving technologies, distributed Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been developed, aimed at bringing the computation environments near the end-users, usually in one hop, to reach predefined requirements. In the literature, offloading approaches are developed to connect the computation environments to mobile devices by transferring resource-hungry tasks to the near servers. Because of some rising problems such as inherent software and hardware heterogeneity, restrictions, dynamism, and stochastic behavior of the ecosystem, the computation offloading issues consider as the essential challenging problems in the MEC environment. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, in spite of its significance, in machine learning-based (ML-based) computation offloading mechanisms, there is not any systematic, comprehensive, and detailed survey in the MEC environment. In this paper, we provide a review on the ML-based computation offloading mechanisms in the MEC environment in the form of a classical taxonomy to identify the contemporary mechanisms on this crucial topic and to offer open issues as well. The proposed taxonomy is classified into three main fields: Reinforcement learning-based mechanisms, supervised learning-based mechanisms, and unsupervised learning-based mechanisms. Next, these classes are compared with each other based on the essential features such as performance metrics, case studies, utilized techniques, and evaluation tools, and their advantages and weaknesses are discussed, as well.

;AI system architecture design methodology based on IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure for successful AI adoption in organizations;Seungkyu Park and Joong yoon Lee and Jooyeoun Lee;Data & Knowledge Engineering;2024;Science@Direct;102264;150;With the advancement of AI technology, the successful AI adoption in organizations has become a top priority in modern society. However, many organizations still struggle to articulate the necessary AI, and AI experts have difficulties understanding the problems faced by these organizations. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for organizations to identify the technical requirements, such as necessary data and algorithms, for adopting AI. To overcome this problem, we propose a new AI system architecture design methodology based on the IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure. The IMO structure enables effective identification of the technical requirements necessary to develop real AI models. While previous research has identified the importance and challenges of technical requirements, such as data and AI algorithms, for AI adoption, there has been little research on methodology to concretize them. Our methodology is composed of three stages: problem definition, system AI solution, and AI technical solution to design the AI technology and requirements that organizations need at a system level. The effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through a case study, logical comparative analysis with other studies, and experts reviews, which demonstrate that our methodology can support successful AI adoption to organizations.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2023.102264;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X23001246;;;AI(Artificial intelligence), AI system architecture design, System engineering, Requirements engineering, AI adoption;;0169-023X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research;Jonna Koivisto and Juho Hamari;International Journal of Information Management;2019;Science@Direct;191-210;45;Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.10.013;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401217305169;;;Gamification, Games, Motivational information system, Affordance, Literature review;;0268-4012;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;An evaluation method of channel state information fingerprinting for single gateway indoor localization;Brieuc Berruet and Oumaya Baala and Alexandre Caminada and Valery Guillet;Journal of Network and Computer Applications;2020;Science@Direct;102591;159;The proliferation of location-based services highlights the need to develop an accurate indoor localization solution. The global navigation satellite system does not deliver good accuracy indoors because of weak signal. One solution is to piggyback Wi-Fi technology, which is widespread in offices and domestic environments. This wireless communication has a promising future, with the possibility to estimate locations with a single gateway by combining channel state information with fingerprinting. However, the existing solutions are often limited to a specific setup and are hard to replicate in other situations. Furthermore, channel state information consists of complex data, which hampers the learning phase of machine learning techniques. This paper assesses the performances of unsupervised data complexity reduction methods by considering different data collection scenarios with multiple antenna elements at the anchor gateway. The study puts forward an evaluation method based on five heuristic scores to guide the design of future fingerprinting solutions based on channel state information. This has been extended to several spatial distributions of training locations, and we show that the kernel entropy component analysis is more suitable for implementation than the principal component analysis, the factor analysis, the independent component analysis and the kernel principal component analysis.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102591;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804520300655;;;Performance assessment, CSI Fingerprinting, Indoor localization, Single gateway, Unsupervised data complexity reduction, SIMO, Data collection scenarios;;1084-8045;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Why do consumers adopt smart voice assistants for shopping purposes? A perspective from complexity theory;Dimah Al-Fraihat and Maram Alzaidi and Mike Joy;Intelligent Systems with Applications;2023;Science@Direct;200230;18;The widespread appeal of Smart Voice Assistants (SVAs) stems from their ability to enhance the everyday lives of consumers in a practical, enjoyable, and meaningful manner. Despite their popularity, the factors that shape consumer adoption of SVAs remain largely unexplored. To address this research gap, we utilized complexity theory to construct an integrated model that sheds light on the determinants of consumer decision-making in regard to SVA adoption. Furthermore, we applied fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to examine the proposed model and uncover the causal recipes associated with SVA adoption. Our necessary condition analysis highlights that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived humanness, and perceived social presence are necessary predictors for consumers' intentions to adopt SVA. This study constitutes a significant addition to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the drivers of SVA adoption. Moreover, it offers crucial implications for online service provider managers to improve the adoption of SVAs among their customers.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iswa.2023.200230;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667305323000558;;;Smart voice assistants, Complexity theory, fsQCA, SVA adoption, Functional and social variables;;2667-3053;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Context-awareness for the design of Smart-product service systems: Literature review;Angela Carrera-Rivera and Felix Larrinaga and Ganix Lasa;Computers in Industry;2022;Science@Direct;103730;142;"Smart-Product Service Systems (S-PSS) emerge as a novel strategy to integrate smart products with advanced digital capabilities and their related e-services to satisfy user’s needs in highly context-dependent environments.

However, being able to exploit the digital capabilities of smart products and their services is still limited in design and even more to improve the user experience. For this reason, this study will focus on the Context-awareness capability that has been defined by multiple scholars as one of the most relevant properties that defines the smartness of a product. Following a systematic literature review approach, this work makes the following contributions: (1) it provides a bibliometric analysis using a cluster keyword map to analyze the most researched topics in S-PSS relevant to the design, user experience and analyze their connections; (2) an analysis of the case studies presented in the literature according to the life cycle of context-aware applications; and (3) establishes a research direction for the user experience and design of the S-PSS.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2022.103730;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361522001270;;;Smart-product service systems, Context-awareness, User-centred design, User experience;;0166-3615;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Load balancing of energy cloud using wind driven and firefly algorithms in internet of everything;Swarna Priya R.M. and Sweta Bhattacharya and Praveen Kumar Reddy Maddikunta and Siva Rama Krishnan Somayaji and Kuruva Lakshmanna and Rajesh Kaluri and Aseel Hussien and Thippa Reddy Gadekallu;Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing;2020;Science@Direct;16-26;142;"The smart applications dominating the planet in the present day and age, have innovatively progressed to deploy Internet of Things (IoT) based systems and related infrastructures in all spectrums of life. Since, variety of applications are being developed using this IoT paradigm, there is an immense necessity for storing data, processing them to get meaningful information and render suitable services to the end-users. The “thing” in this decade is not only a smart sensor or a device; it can be any physical or household object, a smart device or a mobile. With the ever increasing rise in population and smart device usage in every sphere of life, when all of such “thing”s generates data, there is a chance of huge data traffic in the internet. This could be handled only by integrating “Internet of Everything (IoE)” paradigm with a completely diversified technology — Cloud Computing. In order to handle this heavy flow of data traffic and process the same to generate meaningful information, various services in the global environment are utilized. Hence the primary focus revolves in integrating these two diversified paradigm shifts to develop intelligent information processing systems. Energy Efficient Cloud Based Internet of Everything (EECloudIoE) architecture is proposed in this study, which acts as an initial step in integrating these two wide areas thereby providing valuable services to the end users. The utilization of energy is optimized by clustering the various IoT network using Wind Driven Optimization Algorithm. Next, an optimized Cluster Head (CH) is chosen for each cluster, using Firefly Algorithm resulting in reduced data traffic in comparison to other non-clustering schemes. The proposed clustering of IoE is further compared with the widely used state of the art techniques like Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adaptive Gravitational Search algorithm (AGSA). The results justify the superiority of the proposed methodology outperforming the existing approaches with an increased life-time and reduction in traffic.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.02.010;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731520300356;;;Green communication, Energy cloud, Internet of everything (IoE), Wind driven algorithm, Firefly algorithm;;0743-7315;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Decision-support framework to evaluate the practicality of 5G for intralogistics use cases in standalone non-public networks;Thorge Lackner and Johannes L. Jooste and Daniel Palm;Procedia CIRP;2023;Science@Direct;51-56;120;In the context of Industry 4.0, intralogistics faces an increasingly complex and dynamic environment driven by a high level of product customisation and complex manufacturing processes. One approach to deal with these changing conditions is the decentralised and intelligent connectivity of intralogistics systems. However, wireless connectivity presents a major challenge in the industry due to strict requirements such as safety and real-time data transmission. In this context, the fifth generation of mobile communications (5G) is a promising technology to meet the requirements of safety-critical applications. Particularly, since 5G offers the possibility of establishing private 5G networks, also referred to as standalone non-public networks. Through their isolation from public networks, private 5G networks provide exclusive coverage for private organisations offering them high intrinsic network control and data security. However, 5G is still under development and is being gradually introduced in a continuous release process. This process lacks transparency regarding the performance of 5G in individual releases, complicating the successful adoption of 5G as an industrial communication. Additionally, the evaluation of 5G against the specified target performance is insufficient due to the impact of the environment and external interfering factors on 5G in the industrial environment. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a technical decision-support framework that takes a holistic approach to evaluate the practicality of 5G for intralogistics use cases by considering two fundamental stages. The first of these analyses technical parameters and characteristics of the use case to evaluate the theoretical feasibility of 5G. The second stage investigates the application's environment, which substantially impacts the practicality of 5G, for instance, the influence of surrounding materials. Finally, a case study validates the proposed framework by means of an autonomous mobile robot. As a result, the validation proves the proposed framework's applicability and shows the practicality of the autonomous mobile robot, when integrating it into a private 5G network testbed.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.08.010;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827123006819;;;Decision-support framework, 5G, intralogistics, use cases, non-public networks, private 5G networks, practicality;;2212-8271;;56th CIRP International Conference on Manufacturing Systems 2023;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A systematic review of global research on natural user interface for smart home system;Longhui Liao and Yifei Liang and Hong Li and Yuehua Ye and Guangdong Wu;International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics;2023;Science@Direct;103445;95;The smart home system (SHS) equipped with intelligent sensors and actuators aims at providing seamless services for users. The natural user interface (NUI) enables intuitive interaction between users and the SHS, significantly lowering the barrier to entry and enhancing user experience. However, a comprehensive evaluation of research on NUI for the SHS to provide a valuable synthesis of existing research and informing future research directions remains unavailable. This study attempts to address this gap by systematically evaluating 1979 relevant journal and conference articles from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus, and those articles with a weak connection to the topic and poor data integrity were excluded. Finally, 1330 articles were chosen to for analysis in terms of contributions, critical papers, co-occurrence, and clustering using scientometric techniques. It was revealed that, with the help of advancing technologies, the research field of NUI aims to enrich the variety of interactive device types, improve the accuracy of interpreting and responding to user behavior, and optimize the compatibility with diverse user demographics. Besides, a conceptual framework summarizing typical types of NUI for the SHS was proposed, and strengths and weaknesses of each NUI were discussed for investigating specific future directions. Furthermore, four general research directions (strategies for promoting effective multimodal NUI, adoption of artificial intelligence for better performance, exploration of mixed reality applications in the SHS, and standardization of protocols in the smart home ecosystem) were also identified for academics and practitioners in their future research and practice.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2023.103445;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169814123000379;;;Smart home system, Human-machine interface, Natural user interface, Scientometric analysis;;0169-8141;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;NRPose: Towards noise resistance for multi-person pose estimation;Jianhang He and Junyao Sun and Qiong Liu and Shaowu Peng;Pattern Recognition;2023;Science@Direct;109680;142;The high signal-to-noise ratio is one of the main challenges of multi-person pose estimation (MPE) and receives little attention. In this work, we find that MPE suffers from two types of noise: aleatoric noise and epistemic noise. The former represents the noise inherent in the observations, such as the background. The latter indicates the noise brought by the priori hypotheses, such as the inappropriate keypoint relations. Both of them reduce the saliency of information available for keypoint localization. We propose the noise-resistance pose estimation (NRPose) that integrates keypoint-oriented region proposal module (KRPM) and pose-aware sparse relation module (PSRM). To mitigate aleatoric noise, KRPM generates keypoint-level RoIs by circumscribing semantically significant regions. To reduce epistemic noise, PSRM filters out the noisy relations dynamically by modeling the noise propagation and keypoint interaction. NRPose outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 1.0 AP on COCO and OCHuman dataset.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2023.109680;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320323003801;;;Multi-person pose estimation, Noise resistance, Region proposal, Keypoint relation;;0031-3203;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Towards immersive comprehension of software systems using augmented reality: an empirical evaluation;Mehra, Rohit and Sharma, Vibhu Saujanya and Kaulgud, Vikrant and Podder, Sanjay and Burden, Adam P.;;2021;ACM Digital Library;1267–1269;;While traditionally, software comprehension relies on approaches like reading through the code or looking at charts on screens, which are 2D mediums, there have been some recent approaches that advocate exploring 3D approaches like Augmented or Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to have a richer experience towards understanding software and its internal relationships. However, there is a dearth of objective studies that compare such 3D representations with their traditional 2D counterparts in the context of software comprehension. In this paper, we present an evaluation study to quantitatively and qualitatively compare 2D and 3D software representations with respect to typical comprehension tasks. For the 3D medium, we utilize an AR-based approach for 3D visualizations of a software system (XRaSE), while the 2D medium comprises of textual IDEs and 2D graph representations. The study, which has been conducted using 20 professional developers, shows that for most comprehension tasks, the developers perform much better using the 3D representation, especially in terms of velocity and recollection, while also displaying reduced cognitive load and better engagement.;;10.1145/3324884.3418907;https://doi.org/10.1145/3324884.3418907;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45455;annazenaide;necio.veras;Rejected;

;Software documentation and augmented reality: love or arranged marriage?;Chimalakonda, Sridhar and Venigalla, Akhila Sri Manasa;;2020;ACM Digital Library;1529–1532;;There is a significant rise in the availability, development and size of software projects in the present day. Many open source projects are reused or updated for various purposes that include fixing bugs in existing projects, development and maintenance of project extensions. Developers who interact with the projects might require documentation for better comprehension of the project and to develop extensions. Most of the software projects currently do not have sufficient documentation or it is not updated along with the project. If some projects have reasonably sufficient documentation, it is usually difficult to comprehend it either for maintenance or for reuse purposes. Considering the usefulness of Augmented Reality (AR) towards comprehension, we propose the vision of integrating the domains of augmented reality and software documentation, and specifically, visualization of software documentation using AR. In this paper, we present some of the directions that could be explored towards this vision and also present an example visualization scenario for API documentation using neural system metaphor. We see this paper as a basis for the future research direction of leveraging AR towards making documentation as a primary artifact in the software development process.;;10.1145/3368089.3417044;https://doi.org/10.1145/3368089.3417044;;;Visualization, Software Documentation, Augmented Reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;The paper is related to the use of AR in the context of teaching Software Engineering;45350;45418;annazenaide;annazenaide;Accepted;

;Design and evaluation of a revised ARCS motivational model for online classes in higher education;Monica Maiti and M. Priyaadharshini and Harini. S;Heliyon;2023;Science@Direct;e22729;9;"In recent years, online MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been quite popular among universities which helps learners to enhance their competency skills apart from learning the regular college/university curriculum. Although distance education and online learning have been adopted gradually recently, it has become the 'New Normal.' In this situation of uncertainty, facilitators must keep themselves updated with the various teaching/learning strategies and encourage learners to get accustomed to the online classroom environment. Furthermore, assisting the learners with active engagement in the classes is essential. Hence, to create an instigated environment for assessing the competency level and addressing the motivational behaviour of the learners in the online courses, a modified version of the ""ARCS"" (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) model is used in this research work. The core objective of this model is to apply a modified motivational model, namely ""ARCS-PC,"" where PC represents Professional Competency. Professional competency includes Critical Thinking skills, Digital literacy, Creative Thinking, Problem-solving, and Time Management. The incorporation of digital quizzes, assignments, and interactive activities using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools was done in the ARCS-PC Model. The online classroom lectures and activities were conducted using the Microsoft Teams (MS Teams) educational platform. Linear regression is performed to analyze the modified ARCS-PC model. These technology-enabled online classes and ICT tools have helped teach lifelong learning, collaborative learning, a student-centric approach, and better competency skills to effectively engage students in online courses. In our proposed method, an improvement of 11.21 % was observed in the student's performance compared to a maximum of 8.8 % in the existing traditional models. Detailed analysis and quantification of the proposed method are given in the paper.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22729;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023099371;;;Lifelong learning, ARCS model, ICT tools, Competency skills, Rubrics evaluation, Regression model;;2405-8440;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Firstly, since multi-orientation features are among the key visual stimuli in the human visual system (HVS) to perceive object spatial information, discrete wavelet frame transform (DWDT) is applied to extract directionality characteristics for calculating the centoid of remarkable objects in the original image. Then, the color contrast feature is used to represent the physical characteristics of salient objects. Thirdly, in order to explore and utilize the background features of an input image, sparse dictionary learning is performed to statistically analyze and estimate the background feature map. Finally, three distinctive cues of the directional feature including the color contrast feature and the background feature are combined to generate a final robust saliency map. Experimental results on three widely used image datasets show that our proposed method is effective and efficient, and is superior to other state-of-the-art saliency-detection models.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114219;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420309441;;;Discrete wavelet transform, Saliency detection, Background features, Position prior;;0957-4174;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Our study aimed to examine the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching Python programming principles. The study consisted of three phases: a systematic review of AR using the PRISMA statement, the development of a mobile AR application called “EDUpy,” and the evaluation of EDUpy through two experiences with undergraduate students enrolled in different course units. The study found 30 studies in literature focused on the introduction of AR in educational contexts, ranging from kindergarten to higher education. Additionally, 57 students were enrolled in the experiences and the results showed that EDUpy was suitable in terms of user experience and effective in achieving students' learning goals. Further research is necessary to determine the impact of the application on students' soft skills, such as creativity, engagement, motivation, teamwork, and self-learning.;;10.1109/EDUCON54358.2023.10125256;;;;"Systematics;User experience;Distance measurement;Teamwork;Mobile applications;Engineering education;Augmented reality;Augmented reality;Python;programming;software engineering education";;2165-9567;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Duplicated;

Innovations like distributed computing, Machine Learning (ML), blockchain, chatbots, wearables, and pattern recognition can adequately enable the collection and processing of medical data for decision-making in the healthcare era. Particularly, to assist experts in the disease diagnostic process, distributed computing is beneficial by digesting huge volumes of data swiftly and producing personalized smart suggestions. On the other side, the current globe is confronting an outbreak of COVID-19, so an early diagnosis technique is crucial to lowering the fatality rate. ML systems are beneficial in aiding radiologists in examining the incredible amount of medical images. Nevertheless, they demand a huge quantity of training data that must be unified for processing. Hence, developing Deep Learning (DL) confronts multiple issues, such as conventional data collection, quality assurance, knowledge exchange, privacy preservation, administrative laws, and ethical considerations. In this research, we intend to convey an inclusive analysis of the most recent studies in distributed computing platform applications based on five categorized platforms, including cloud computing, edge, fog, IoT, and hybrid platforms. So, we evaluated 27 articles regarding the usage of the proposed framework, deployed methods, and applications, noting the advantages, drawbacks, and the applied dataset and screening the security mechanism and the presence of the Transfer Learning (TL) method. As a result, it was proved that most recent research (about 43%) used the IoT platform as the environment for the proposed architecture, and most of the studies (about 46%) were done in 2021. In addition, the most popular utilized DL algorithm was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a percentage of 19.4%. Hence, despite how technology changes, delivering appropriate therapy for patients is the primary aim of healthcare-associated departments. Therefore, further studies are recommended to develop more functional architectures based on DL and distributed environments and better evaluate the present healthcare data analysis models.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107745;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016926072300411X;;;Medical data processing, Healthcare data analysis, Deep learning, Distributed computing;;0169-2607;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Midwifery students' opinions about episiotomy training and using virtual reality: A qualitative study;Zeliha Demir-Kaymak and Zekiye Turan and Gülüzar Çit and Serefraz Akyaman;Nurse Education Today;2024;Science@Direct;106013;132;"Background
The use of simulations and digital technologies in education in the health field is common. Virtual reality technologies, which offer three-dimensional (immersive) simulation environments, have become easily accessible and cost-effective in recent years and this has this has increased this use of this technology in educating students who will work in the health field.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to investigate the views of midwifery undergraduate students about the current episiotomy education they received and their expectations when related education is given with virtual reality technology.
Participants
Students in their third or fourth year of undergraduate midwifery who have taken prior episiotomy education.
Design
The research was carried out as a phenomenological design for qualitative research. Data were collected between December 2022 and January 2023 at a public university in Türkiye, with institutional ethical approval.
Methods
Participants were asked open-ended questions to collect qualitative data. Data were analysed using content analysis by MaxQDA.
Results
Data were analysed, and four main themes were determined. These main themes consisted of 16 sub-themes, and included midwifery department students' positive and negative opinions about the current episiotomy education and their expectations in cases where the education is carried out using virtual education environments.
Conclusions
Although the current episiotomy education has positive aspects, such as suturing ability, it does not give a sense of reality, is not repetitive, and has many negative aspects, such as cost. It was determined that in virtual reality episiotomy education environments, students' expectations are similar to the real birth environment, and they have expectations of simulating risky situations because they think it will be more useful.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2023.106013;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691723003076;;;Midwifery education, Episiotomy, Virtual reality, Qualitative research;;0260-6917;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Democratic learning: hardware/software co-design for lightweight blockchain-secured on-device machine learning;Rui Zhang and Mingcong Song and Tao Li and Zhibin Yu and Yuting Dai and Xiaoguang Liu and Gang Wang;Journal of Systems Architecture;2021;Science@Direct;102205;118;Recently, the trending 5G technology encourages extensive applications of on-device machine learning, which collects user data for model training. This requires cost-effective techniques to preserve the privacy and the security of model training within the resource-constrained environment. Traditional learning methods rely on the trust among the system for privacy and security. However, with the increase of the learning scale, maintaining every edge device’s trustworthiness could be expensive. To cost-effectively establish trust in a trustless environment, this paper proposes democratic learning (DemL), which makes the first step to explore hardware/software co-design for blockchain-secured decentralized on-device learning. By utilizing blockchain’s decentralization and tamper-proofing, our design secures AI learning in a trustless environment. To tackle the extra overhead introduced by blockchain, we propose PoMC (an algorithm and architecture co-design) as a novel blockchain consensus mechanism, which first exploits cross-domain reuse (AI learning and blockchain consensus) in AI learning architecture. Evaluation results show our DemL can protect AI learning from privacy leakage and model pollution, and demonstrated that privacy and security come with trivial hardware overhead and power consumption (2%). We believe that our work will open the door of synergizing blockchain and on-device learning for security and privacy.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2021.102205;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762121001466;;;Architecture/software co-design, Security support, Privacy support, Accelerator, Application-specific system, Emerging computing platform;;1383-7621;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;piARno - An Augmented Reality Piano Tutor;"Rigby, Liam and W\""{u}nsche, Burkhard C. and Shaw, Alex";;2021;ACM Digital Library;481–491;;Music is an important way for humans to express themselves, unite, relate, and gain enjoyment. While many people desire for themselves, or their loved ones, to achieve some form of musical prowess, the discipline remains encumbered by low motivation and high dropout rates. This is despite long established trends between exposure to learning playing an instrument and enhanced cognitive development. Previous research suggests that one factor associated with motivation loss might be the lack of perceived progress during the early stages of music instruction. In this paper we develop a novel Augmented Reality piano tutor with the primary goal of increasing the effectiveness of self-practice for beginners. Our solution is based on the principle of constant feedback and reducing the level of indirection between instrument, instructions, and feedback, and enables users to learn to read and understand piano sheet music quickly without requiring a private instructor, while maintaining compatibility with the traditional learning process. An evaluation of our solution with a user study containing 22 participants showed that our tool significantly improved motivation and the ability to read piano sheet music.;;10.1145/3441000.3441039;https://doi.org/10.1145/3441000.3441039;;;teaching, sheet music, piano, learning, feedback, augmented reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Physicality As an Anchor for Coordination: Examining Collocated Collaboration in Physical and Mobile Augmented Reality Settings;Poretski, Lev Poretski and Lanir, Joel and Margalit, Ram and Arazy, Ofer;Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;5;Design and co-creation activities around 3D artifacts often require close collocated coordination between multiple users. Augmented reality (AR) technology can support collocated work enabling users to flexibly work with digital objects while still being able to use the physical space for coordination. With most of current research focusing on remote AR collaboration, less is known about collocated collaboration in AR, particularly in relation to interpersonal dynamics between the collocated collaborators. Our study aims at understanding how shared augmented reality facilitated by mobile devices (mobile augmented reality or MAR) affects collocated users' coordination. We compare the coordination behaviors that emerged in a MAR setting with those in a comparable fully physical setting by simulating the same task -of the shared physical dimension for participants' ability to coordinate in the context of collaborative co-creation. Namely, participants working in a fully physical setting were better able to leverage the work artifact itself for their coordination needs, working in a mode that we term artifact-oriented coordination. Conversely, participants collaborating around an AR artifact leveraged the shared physical workspace for their coordination needs, working in what we refer to as space-oriented coordination. We discuss implications for a AR-based collaboration and propose directions for designers of AR tools.;;10.1145/3479857;https://doi.org/10.1145/3479857;;;mutual awareness, mobile augmented reality, coordination, collaborative co-creation, collaboration;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Designing a mobile learning application model by integrating augmented reality and game elements to improve student learning experience;Ramli, Ratna Zuarni and Sahari Ashaari, Noraidah and Mat Noor, Siti Fadzilah and Noor, Mahanem Mat and Yadegaridehkordi, Elaheh and Abd Majid, Nazatul Aini and Dahlan, Hadi Affendy and Abdul Wahab, Amelia Natasya;Education and Information Technologies;2023;ACM Digital Library;1981–2008;29;"Learning Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects in an online medium can be difficult and tedious. Lengthy facts with technical terms, complex images, and explanations are among the reasons that make STEM subjects less desirable among the current generation and degrade the students’ learning experience. Students can be assisted with learning applications that are not only mobile but also integrated with features that are enjoyable to trigger students’ interest in STEM. Game elements and augmented reality (AR) are two technologies that are capable of improving students’ learning experience. However, there are limited guidelines for designing mobile learning applications that are based on game elements and AR. Moreover, the existing guidelines mostly focus on usability but not the overall learning experience. Therefore, this paper aims to design a model of a mobile learning application that integrates AR and game elements to improve the student learning experience. The model consists of three elements; content, pedagogy/technology, and interaction that was initially verified by the subject matter experts. A mobile application prototype called m-BioP was developed based on the model and tested heuristically. A complete version of m-BioP was evaluated in an experimental study with 30 respondents using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Respondents were biology students aged between 16 and 23 years that were recruited by purposive sampling. The results were positive on almost all features of m-BioP with values higher than 0.8 on the pragmatic and hedonic scale, thus approving the developed model. Based on the evaluation, the only aspect that requires improvement is the design of the videos. The model can be used by academicians and learning content creators as a guideline to design and develop mobile learning applications that are able to provide STEM students with a better learning experience.";;10.1007/s10639-023-11874-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-023-11874-7;;;Augmented reality, Game, Learning experience, Mobile application, STEM;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1360-2357;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Meta-AR-App: An Authoring Platform for Collaborative Augmented Reality in STEM Classrooms;Villanueva, Ana and Zhu, Zhengzhe and Liu, Ziyi and Peppler, Kylie and Redick, Thomas and Ramani, Karthik;;2020;ACM Digital Library;1–14;;Augmented Reality (AR) has become a valuable tool for education and training processes. Meanwhile, cloud-based technologies can foster collaboration and other interaction modalities to enhance learning. We combine the cloud capabilities with AR technologies to present Meta-AR-App, an authoring platform for collaborative AR, which enables authoring between instructors and students. Additionally, we introduce a new application of an established collaboration process, the pull-based development model, to enable sharing and retrieving of AR learning content. We customize this model and create two modalities of interaction for the classroom: local (student to student) and global (instructor to class) pull. Based on observations from our user studies, we organize a four-category classroom model which implements our system: Work, Design, Collaboration, and Technology. Further, our system enables an iterative improvement workflow of the class content and enables synergistic collaboration that empowers students to be active agents in the learning process.;;10.1145/3313831.3376146;https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376146;;;augmented reality, authoring, classroom, collaboration, electrical circuitry, git, pull-based model, stem, version control;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Language Learning with Mobile Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder;El Shemy, Ibrahim;;2022;ACM Digital Library;658–661;;Augmented Reality has gained popularity among special needs communities. The flexibility and the advanced capabilities of this technology, empowered with AI, are opening new opportunities for further research in the area of digitally-aided language interventions for children with ASD. The goal of this research is to investigate and develop new knowledge tools to support language learning in children with ASD. The research methodology would be both qualitative and quantitative, using interviews, participatory design, and observations. Initially, this project will define the theoretical and existing applications of adaptive AR interventions for children with autism. A preliminary investigation has been conducted, suggesting promising results that can shed a light on the opportunities offered by AR and AI for language learning. In the next phase, we will design and develop a novel adaptive mobile AR application based on activities like workshops and participatory design, followed by systematic empirical evaluations of the proposed solution.;;10.1145/3501712.3538827;https://doi.org/10.1145/3501712.3538827;;;Language Learning, Children, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A QoE evaluation of procedural and example instruction formats for procedure training in augmented reality;Hynes, Eoghan and Flynn, Ronan and Lee, Brian and Murray, Niall;;2022;ACM Digital Library;287–292;;Augmented reality (AR) has significant potential as a training platform. The pedagogical purpose of training is learning or transfer. Learning is the acquisition of an ability to perform a procedure as taught while transfer involves generalising that knowledge to similar procedures in the same domain. Quality of experience (QoE) concerns the fulfilment of the application, system or service user's pragmatic and hedonic needs and expectations. Learning or transfer fulfil the AR trainee's pragmatic needs. Training instructions can be presented in procedural, and example formats. Procedural instructions tell the trainee what to do while examples show the trainee how to do it. These two different instruction formats can influence learning, transfer, and hardware resource availability differently. The AR trainee's hedonic needs and expectations may be influenced by the impact of instruction format resource consumption on system performance. Efficient training efficacy is a design concern for mobile AR training applications. This work aims to inform AR training application design by evaluating the influence of procedural and example instruction formats on AR trainee QoE.In this demo, an AR GoCube™ solver training application will be exhibited on the state-of-the-art Hololens 2 (HL2) mixed reality (MR) headset. This AR training app is part of a test framework that will be used in a between groups study to evaluate the influence of text-based and animated 3D model instruction formats on AR trainee QoE. This framework will record the trainee's physiological ratings, eye gaze features and facial expressions. Learning will be evaluated in a post-training recall phase while transfer will be evaluated using a pre and post training comparison of mental rotation skills. Application profiling code will monitor AR headset resource consumption.;;10.1145/3524273.3532899;https://doi.org/10.1145/3524273.3532899;;;training, quality of experience, micro facial expressions, memory, learning, eye gaze, cognitive load, augmented reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Co-design of Augmented Reality Storybooks for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder;Alkadhi, Bushra and Alnafisi, Ghadah and Aljowair, Layan and Alotaibi, Leena and Alduaifi, Nouf and Alhumood, Raghad;;2020;ACM Digital Library;3–13;;Spectrum of autism is one of the most serious disorders that negatively affect the normal development of the brain. Children with autism usually face different levels of difficulties in communication and practicing essential life skills such as reading due to language delays and intellectual disability. The limitations in manipulating written text as well as understanding it make it challenging for them to read and enjoy storybooks, and here where technology-based interventions can take place. Yohka is an Arabic augmented reality storybook application designed for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their caregivers to enhance their reading experience and communication. It shows a more interactive and animated version of the story that helps the child to understand the story and the interactions between its characters, which make it enjoyable and therapeutic at the same time. The design of reading companions is rapidly growing in the interaction design domains. While the promise of interactive learning technologies has widely been demonstrated and relevant research is proliferating, little is known about how augmented reality applications might play a positive role in this development and the effective design process is not necessarily recognized. This paper describes the collective creative co-design process that was followed in Yohka as a user-centered design project for developing augmented reality application for - and with - children on the autism spectrum and its consequences on the finished application. It discusses the design innovation modules for ASD technologies and the effective role of relevant stakeholders and expert evaluation in achieving high standards while designing such technologies. Children, parents, specialists, and caregivers have been actively involved since early stages of the project as co-designers and have contributed hugely through different ways and mediums that are covered in this paper. Designing with the users through several iterations helps in promoting usability especially for this kind of educational and therapeutic technologies. Design implications and future directions for this work are also discussed.;;10.1007/978-3-030-60149-2_1;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-60149-2_1;;;Children, Co-create, Co-design, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Augmented reality, User centered design;Springer-Verlag;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Towards an Ambient Smart City: Using Augmented Reality to Geospatially Filter the Right Airbnb via Artificial Intelligence;Chopra, Shreya and Addam, Omar;;2021;ACM Digital Library;472–489;;We investigate an augmented reality (AR) based method to help the user filter their preferred Airbnb home via artificial intelligence (AI) on a 3-dimensional street view style map in the context of a smart home and smart city ambient scenario. We are motivated by seeking to provide users a 3-dimensional AR interface that: provides equal representation of all data points and allows visual filtration of all filter dimensions directly on the map. We introduce a novel way of visually filtering information geospatially on an AR map by adding information instead of removing it called filtration by inclusion. We introduce the interface in its environmental context in terms of strategic locations for embedding it around the city. We demonstrate how a neural network model can be applied to our filtration technique to act as a human and make filtration decisions. We enforce how technology should enable, not limit the user and discuss how our system does not filter out a home if it does not match the filter criteria, but rather provides the visual information for the user to be able to make that decision on their own as human choices are fluid. We expand upon some limitations of our system and discuss future work on this technology.

;GLEAM: An Illumination Estimation Framework for Real-time Photorealistic Augmented Reality on Mobile Devices;Prakash, Siddhant and Bahremand, Alireza and Nguyen, Linda D. and LiKamWa, Robert;;2019;ACM Digital Library;142–154;;Mixed reality mobile platforms attempt to co-locate virtual scenes with physical environments, towards creating immersive user experiences. However, to create visual harmony between virtual and physical spaces, the virtual scene must be accurately illuminated with realistic lighting that matches the physical environment. To this end, we design GLEAM, a framework that provides robust illumination estimation in real-time by integrating physical light-probe estimation with current mobile AR systems. GLEAM visually observes reflective objects to compose a realistic estimation of physical lighting. Optionally, GLEAM can network multiple devices to sense illumination from different viewpoints and compose a richer estimation to enhance realism and fidelity. Using GLEAM, AR developers gain the freedom to use a wide range of materials, which is currently limited by the unrealistic appearance of materials that need accurate illumination, such as liquids, glass, and smooth metals. Our controlled environment user studies across 30 participants reveal the effectiveness of GLEAM in providing robust and adaptive illumination estimation over commercial status quo solutions, such as pre-baked directional lighting and ARKit 2.0 illumination estimation. Our benchmarks reveal the need for situation driven tradeoffs to optimize for quality factors in situations requiring freshness over quality and vice-versa. Optimizing for different quality factors in different situations, GLEAM can update scene illumination as fast as 30ms by sacrificing richness and fidelity in highly dynamic scenes, or prioritize quality by allowing an update interval as high as 400ms in scenes that require high-fidelity estimation.;;10.1145/3307334.3326098;https://doi.org/10.1145/3307334.3326098;;;lighting models, light probe, light estimation, image-based lighting, image processing, geometry, augmented reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

End-user involvement during product design has been linked to the development of more useful and usable solutions as it helps create a smooth transition between research, environment, and daily practice.

The concept of SBSE is based on the idea of formulation of software engineering problem as a search-based optimization problem and effective exploitation of metaheuristic search optimizers to solve it. The complex nature of software engineering problems and complex computational behaviour of the metaheuristic search algorithms makes the SBSE approaches challenging to understand and analyze. A variety of multimedia technologies are generally used to make the problem formulation and their computational method more understandable and analyzable. Even after wide application of multimedia in science and engineering, the SBSE got little attention in this direction. To explore and exploit the potential of the multimedia in the SBSE, this work first conducted a research study on the current trends of multimedia in SBSE, then based on this study, the various challenges and opportunities are presented. More specifically, our work mainly focusses on current multimedia trends in various forms of SBSE approaches (e.g., single, multi, and many-objective SBSE). Apart from that, we also explore the various opportunities and challenges in SBSE from the perspective of visualization of software artefacts, software quality metrics, problem formulation, search trajectory, Pareto optimal set and front.;;10.1007/s11042-021-11882-0;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-11882-0;;;Search-based optimization, Representations, Search-based software engineering, visualization, Software analysis, Multimedia;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Designing an Augmented Reality Authoring Tool to Support Complex Tasks. A Design Science Study Using Cognitive Load Theory;"H\""{o}nemann, Kay and Konopka, Bj\""{o}rn and Wiesche, Manuel";;2023;ACM Digital Library;87–101;;Despite the potential of augmented reality (AR) to support and guide complex industrial tasks, the technology is still not broadly applied. One possible reason for this is that the creation of AR content is highly complex and requires programming skills and deep spatial knowledge. AR authoring tools can help address this complexity by enabling non-developers to create self-sufficient AR content. Therefore, this paper proposes a theory-driven design for AR authoring tools that allows non-developers to create self-sufficient AR-based instructions to support complex tasks. Based on ten interviews with experts working with AR authoring tools and a following focus group with eight participants, we propose three design principles for future AR authoring tools in the engineering context. These design principles are instantiated in two prototypes of different richness and evaluated in an experiment with 23 students. Our study shows that the cognitive load is slightly increased when using the extensive AR authoring tool, but it also shows that significantly better results can be achieved with the extensive AR authoring tool. We contribute by providing design principles for AR authoring tools for creating AR-based instructions, which extend the existing AR authoring research in the industrial context.;;10.1007/978-3-031-32808-4_6;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32808-4_6;;;Cognitive Load Theory, Design Science Research, AR Authoring, Augmented Reality;Springer-Verlag;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI.

;The Essentials of Modern Software Engineering: Free the Practices from the Method Prisons!;"Jacobson, Ivar and Lawson, Harold ""Bud"" and Ng, Pan-Wei and McMahon, Paul E. and Goedicke, Michael";;2019;ACM Digital Library;;;The first course in software engineering is the most critical. Education must start from an understanding of the heart of software development, from familiar ground that is common to all software development endeavors. This book is an in-depth introduction to software engineering that uses a systematic, universal kernel to teach the essential elements of all software engineering methods.This kernel, Essence, is a vocabulary for defining methods and practices. Essence was envisioned and originally created by Ivar Jacobson and his colleagues, developed by Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) and approved by The Object Management Group (OMG) as a standard in 2014. Essence is a practiceindependent framework for thinking and reasoning about the practices we have and the practices we need. Essence establishes a shared and standard understanding of what is at the heart of software development. Essence is agnostic to any particular method, lifecycle independent, programming language independent, concise, scalable, extensible, and formally specified. Essence frees the practices from their method prisons.The first part of the book describes Essence, the essential elements to work with, the essential things to do and the essential competencies you need when developing software. The other three parts describe more and more advanced use cases of Essence. Using real but manageable examples, it covers the fundamentals of Essence and the innovative use of serious games to support software engineering. It also explains how current practices such as user stories, use cases, Scrum, and microservices can be described using Essence, and illustrates how their activities can be represented using the Essence notions of cards and checklists. The fourth part of the book offers a vision how Essence can be scaled to support large, complex systems engineering.Essence is supported by an ecosystem developed and maintained by a community of experienced people worldwide. From this ecosystem, professors and students can select what they need and create their own way of working, thus learning how to create ONE way of working that matches the particular situation and needs.;;;;;;;"Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan &amp; Claypool";;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

From 865 studies, 74 studies have been selected as primary studies. We have analysed the studies from multiple perspectives, such as motivation, inspiration, and engineering approaches, among others.Results: Results have shown that self-awareness has been used to enable self-adaptation in systems that exhibit uncertain and dynamic behaviour. Though there have been recent attempts to define and engineer self-awareness in software engineering, there is no consensus on the definition of self-awareness. Also, the distinction between self-aware and self-adaptive systems has not been systematically treated.Conclusions: Our survey reveals that self-awareness for software systems is still a formative field and that there is growing attention to incorporate self-awareness for better reasoning about the adaptation decision in autonomic systems.

The purpose of using a machine of this nature is to send it into hazardous mining environments rather than sending workers and having their lives jeopardized. This work is significant because it demonstrates how two separate fields, such as virtual reality and robotics, can be combined to complete useful tasks. It also illustrates how machines can be used to replace workers in hazardous conditions not only in the field of mining, but in other fields as well. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the creation of a panorama of live video feeds captured by several webcams, which can be seen using a VR headset.

;"Hybrid Prior-Based Diminished Reality for&nbsp;Indoor Panoramic Images";Liu, Jiashu and Zhang, Qiudan and Shen, Xuelin and Wu, Wenhui and Wang, Xu;;2024;ACM Digital Library;388–399;;Due to the advancement of hardware technology, e.g. head-mounted display devices, augmented reality (AR) has been widely used. In AR, virtual objects added to the real environment may partially overlap with objects in the real world, leading to a degraded display. Thus, except for adding virtual objects to the real world, diminished reality (DR) is an urgent task that virtually removes, hides, and sees through real objects from panoramas. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for diminished reality in indoor panoramic images with rich prior information. Especially, to restore the structure information, a structure restoration module is developed to aggregate the layout boundary features of the masked panoramic image. Subsequently, we design a structured region texture extraction module to assist the real texture restoration after removing the target object. Ultimately, to explore the relations among structure and texture, we design a fast Fourier convolution fusion module to generate inpainting results respecting real-world structures and textures.

;HoloType: Lived Experience Based Communication Training for Nonspeaking Autistic People;Krishnamurthy, Diwakar and Jaswal, Vikram and Nazari, Ahmadreza and Shahidi, Ali and Subbaraman, Pranav and Wang, Mea;;2022;ACM Digital Library;;;The lived experiences of nonspeaking autistic people are typically not reflected in technology designed to support them. In this paper, we describe insights from nonspeaking autistic people who have learned to communicate by typing and those who support them. We leverage these within an augmented reality communication training prototype. The prototype provides an engaging, personalized learning environment in which a user can systematically develop their pointing skills. Pointing skills combined with elements of language such as spelling can in turn facilitate expressive written communication skills. We describe our requirements elicitation process and provide details about our initial implementation.;;10.1145/3491101.3519869;https://doi.org/10.1145/3491101.3519869;;;autism, augmented reality, assistive communication technology;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Interactive AR Applications for Nonspeaking Autistic People? - A Usability Study;Nazari, Ahmadreza and Shahidi, Ali and Kaufman, Kate M. and Bondi, Julia E and Alabood, Lorans and Jaswal, Vikram K. and Krishnamurthy, Diwakar and Wang, Mea;;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;About one-third of autistic people are nonspeaking, and most are never provided access to an effective alternative to speech. Thoughtfully designed AR applications could provide members of this population with structured learning opportunities, including training on skills that underlie alternative forms of communication. A fundamental step toward creating such opportunities, however, is to investigate nonspeaking autistic people’s ability to tolerate a head-mounted AR device and to interact with virtual objects. We present the first study to examine the usability of an interactive AR-based application by this population. We recruited 17 nonspeaking autistic subjects to play a HoloLens 2 game we developed that involved holographic animations and buttons. Almost all subjects tolerated the device long enough to begin the game, and most completed increasingly challenging tasks that involved pressing holographic buttons. Based on the results, we discuss best practice design and process recommendations. Our findings contradict prevailing assumptions about nonspeaking autistic people and thus open up exciting possibilities for AR-based solutions for this understudied and underserved population.;;10.1145/3544548.3580721;https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580721;;;usability study, nonspeaking autistic people, augmented reality, assistive technology;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Requirements Elicitation for Virtual Reality Products - A Mapping Study;Karre, Sai Anirudh and Mittal, Raghav and Reddy, Raghu;;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;Software practitioners use various requirement elicitation methods to produce a well-defined product. These methods impact the software product’s eventual traits and target a particular audience segment. Virtual Reality(VR) products are no different from this influence. With the notable rise in product offerings across various domains, VR has become an essential technology for the future. Nevertheless, the type of methods practiced for requirement elicitation still has not been thoroughly studied. This paper presents a mapping study on requirement elicitation methods practiced by VR practitioners in academia and industry.

;Usability and User Experience Evaluation of Touchable Holographic Solutions: A Systematic Mapping Study;Campos, Thiago Prado De and Damasceno, Eduardo Filgueiras and Valentim, Natasha Malveira Costa;;2024;ACM Digital Library;;;Interacting with holograms using the hands is on track to reach a broad audience in the coming years. Therefore, a current challenge is understanding how to evaluate this new interaction scenario concerning Usability and User eXperience (UX). In this use context, the user interacts with virtual objects in your real environment. Some already known evaluation technologies have been applied to this type of solution, although they were not created considering aspects such as immersion and presence, typical in this interactive environment. Thus, this paper presents a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) that sought to identify usability and UX evaluation technologies applied to touchable holographic solutions in augmented reality or mixed reality environments. Furthermore, the SMS sought to answer questions about evaluation technologies and holographic solutions. The SMS examined 3551 publications and selected 40 that presented 106 usability or UX evaluation technologies in a touchable holographic solution. The results shed light on methods and aspects little addressed and showed patterns and preferences for combinations of devices, gestures, and feedback types. This work contributes to HCI researchers by better understanding the state of the art of usability and UX evaluation technologies applied to touchable holographic solutions, classifying them, and discussing the main gaps and opportunities.;;10.1145/3638067.3638071;https://doi.org/10.1145/3638067.3638071;;;augmented reality, holograms, mixed reality, systematic mapping study, usability, user experience;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Among various computer-supported learning methods, Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) has been perceived as a promising method in teaching mathematics, promoting students’ interest, and motivation. Therefore, the aim of this systematic literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of literature regarding the effectiveness of DGBL applications in K-12 mathematics education and extend the findings of previous reviews. This study reviewed a total of 43 articles published in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) of Web of Science, and other top-ranked educational technology journals between 2008 and 2019. The findings were then evaluated according to the multi-dimensional framework and classified into three main categories: knowledge acquisition, perceptual and cognitive skills, and affective, motivational, and behavioral change. This revealed that most of the reviewed studies have reported positive gains in all categories, with the traditional method of teaching being the most popular comparison approach. Numerous scholars also demonstrated a particular interest in the subject of arithmetic operations. The study also found that a considerable number of DGBL applications were constructed based on a specific design feature or learning theory. Furthermore, this study highlighted a number of research gaps in this domain according to which more research is required to understand how different dynamics (e.g., collaborative/cooperative, competitive) influence students’ learning. Additionally, more studies are required to address the lack of research on twenty-first-century skills such as creativity and critical thinking. The findings of this review could benefit researchers and educators who are interested in using educational computer games to teach mathematics.;;10.1007/s10639-021-10721-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10721-x;;;Systematic review, Mathematics education, DGBL, Digital game-based learning;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1360-2357;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

However, due to the mobility features of applications, the resource allocation to the workload of applications in distributed dynamic fog networks is becoming a challenging problem. This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in software define network (SDN) enable fog networks. Based on SDN, we distributed the fog network, which consists of many fog nodes. The considered problem contains many stringent constraints (e.g., mobility, deadline, and resource capacity), which are must be satisfied during the execution of applications. Offloading some tasks to fog system performance can be improved by reducing the latency and energy consumption, which are the two important metrics of interest in fog networks. The study proposes a novel container-based architecture with different fog nodes. Based on architecture, the study devises the deep-learning-Q-network based resource-allocation, which consists of various components to solve the problem. The parts are mobility controller, resource searching, and resource allocation, and task migration. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed architecture and schemes better perform existing studies in terms of application costs (energy and execution time) by 30%.;;10.1007/s10515-021-00318-6;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10515-021-00318-6;;;SDN, DQBRA, Cloud, Fog, Scheduling, Offloading, Deep reinforcement learning;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0928-8910;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Virtual Reality (VR) in Engineering Education and Training: A Bibliometric Analysis;Lai, Nai Yeen Gavin and Wong, Kok Hoong and Yu, Lih Jiun and Kang, Hooi Siang;;2020;ACM Digital Library;161–165;;"Although Virtual Reality (VR) was first mentioned in the 60s, the research interest into the technology and its application are still gaining much attention globally. VR technology had evolved and had found niche application in many fields including entertainment, tourism, healthcare, manufacturing, education and more. A notable characteristic of the VR technology is that it seeks to immerse the user into the intended environment and narrative, allowing high user interaction and involvement. These qualities are very beneficial for engineering education. In the past, cost, hardware capabilities and availability, connectivity and other issues had hindered VR wider adoption and application. However, it is changing with the advent of more devices, the involvement of more consumer electronic players and the growth of digitization. This paper seeks to report on the research on virtual reality in engineering education over the past 26 years. The study conducts a bibliometric analysis to reflect the trend of VR in engineering education settings, thus identifying the possible emerging trends. An extensive literature search was conducted using the Scopus database and was analyzed using Vosviewer and Excel. There is an increasing trend of VR research related to the engineering education settings with an evident increase in the scope, the coverage and the citations figures. There is tremendous growth in the number of publications and citations in the recent past four years of the study. The most active author in the field is Sampaio, and the top universities where the publications are affiliated with are Purdue University and Clemson University. The majority of the publications were also found to be affiliated with the ""ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition Conference Proceedings"". The United States had the honor of being the country with the majority of publications from this study. There is a continuous shift of research interest observed through the publications keywords, and this provides an indication of the dynamic progression of research direction among researcher in the field of study. The findings of this study provide a good overview of the trend in research related to VR in engineering education and can serve as a guide to academics seeking to research or adapt the usage of VR in engineering settings.";;10.1145/3425329.3425360;https://doi.org/10.1145/3425329.3425360;;;Virtual reality, VR, Engineering education, Bibliometric analysis;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A Convolutional Neural Network-Based Noise Filtering Method for Photon-Counting LiDAR Data;Yuan, Yizhe and Yin, Changqing and Tan, Tianran;;2021;ACM Digital Library;285–289;;Photon-counting LiDAR plays an important role in the surveying and mapping areas with its advantages of high sensitivity and low emission power. In recent years, LiDAR is used for a variety of scenarios including drones, unmanned vehicles, and even consumer electronics. The photon-counting detection system receives return points on the photon level, which retains rich detail than can be used for analysis. However, it is so sensitive that data are full of noise points. It is important to filter out noise in data preprocessing in order to prevent noise from affecting post-analysis. We proposed a convolutional neural network-based method to solve the noise filtering problem, which accepts varied input sizes and outputs noise labels for each point. Symmetry functions are designed to ensure consistent results on unordered data. Global features are extracted by the shared multilayer perceptron (MLP) and max pooling layer. Local features are extracted from each point and its spatial neighbors through the convolutional operator. We combine global and local features and build the network based on shared MLP to learn pointwise segmentation, which is the label of noise, from these combined features. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated by simulated data and MABEL data. It shows that our method can effectively eliminate most of noise points from data of photon-counting LiDAR.;;10.1145/3443467.3443769;https://doi.org/10.1145/3443467.3443769;;;shared, photon-counting, multilayer perceptron, k-d tree, Convolutional Neural Network;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Virtual reality (VR) technology has been increasingly used in online education to create multisensory interactive learning. However, the technical features of this technology, including high immersion and strong interactions, have not been entirely played substantially. Consequently, improvements in the perceptual learning effect have been hindered. To address these issues, this study built a novel VR interaction model for perceptual learning by introducing reflective thinking variables and individual participation factors from the task-technology fit perspective. Furthermore, the deployment strategy of this model used to build a VR education system was proposed. The usability evaluation results of the proposed model show that the path hypothesis of the novel model is verified.

;VRTest: an extensible framework for automatic testing of virtual reality scenes;Wang, Xiaoyin;;2022;ACM Digital Library;232–236;;Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technique that attracts interest from various application domains such as training, education, remote communication, gaming, and navigation. Despite the ever growing number of VR software projects, the quality assurance techniques for VR software has not been well studied. Therefore, the validation of VR software largely rely on pure manual testing. In this paper, we present a novel testing framework called VRTest to automate the testing of scenes in VR software. In particular, VRTest extracts information from a VR scene and controls the user camera to explore the scene and interact with the virtual objects with certain testing strategies. VRTest currently supports two built-in testing strategies: VRMonkey and VRGreed, which use pure random exploration and greedy algorithm to explore interact-able objects in VR scenes.

Through collaborative modeling, end-users, stakeholders, experts, and entrepreneurs are able to create a shared understanding of a system representation. While the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one of the major conceptual modeling languages in object-oriented software engineering, more and more concerns arise from the modeling quality of UML and its tool-support. Among them, the limitation of the two-dimensional presentation of its notations and lack of natural collaborative modeling tools are reported to be significant. In this paper, we explore the potential of using virtual reality (VR) technology for collaborative UML software design by comparing it with classical collaborative software design using conventional devices (desktop PC/laptop). For this purpose, we have developed a VR modeling environment that offers a natural collaborative modeling experience for UML Class Diagrams. Based on a user study with 24 participants, we have compared collaborative VR modeling with conventional modeling with regard to efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Results show that the use of VR has some disadvantages concerning efficiency and effectiveness, but the user’s fun, the feeling of being in the same room with a remote collaborator, and the naturalness of collaboration were increased.;;10.1007/s10270-022-01065-2;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-022-01065-2;;;Collaborative modeling, Virtual reality, UML;Springer-Verlag;1619-1366;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Considering the strong drivers for edge computing and the relative novelty of the field, it becomes important to understand the specific requirements and characteristics of edge-based CPS, and to ensure that research is guided adequately, e.g., avoiding specific gaps. Our interests lie in the applications of edge computing as part of CPS, where several properties (or attributes) of trustworthiness, including safety, security, and predictability/availability, are of particular concern, each facing challenges for the introduction of edge-based CPS. We present the results of a systematic mapping study, a kind of systematic literature survey, investigating the use of edge computing for CPS with a special emphasis on trustworthiness. The main contributions of this study are a detailed description of the current research efforts in edge-based CPS and the identification and discussion of trends and research gaps. The results show that the main body of research in edge-based CPS only to a very limited extent consider key attributes of system trustworthiness, despite many efforts referring to critical CPS and applications like intelligent transportation. More research and industrial efforts will be needed on aspects of trustworthiness of future edge-based CPS including their experimental evaluation. Such research needs to consider the multiple interrelated attributes of trustworthiness including safety, security, and predictability, and new methodologies and architectures to address them. It is further important to provide bridges and collaboration between edge computing and CPS disciplines.;;10.1145/3539662;https://doi.org/10.1145/3539662;;;Edge computing, fog computing, mobile edge computing, cloudlet, cyber-physical systems, trustworthiness, safety, security, predictability, dependability, critical systems;Association for Computing Machinery;2378-962X;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Sci. Comput. Rev.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1671–1690;41;With the advent of Industry 4.0, future workspaces are expected to evolve in tandem with technological advances in industry and education. Industry 4.0 calls for transformation and effective talent development is vital in ensuring national aspirations are achieved while eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency. As such, this study aims to understand the impact of Industry 4.0 on computer engineering-related workforce and skills development within Multinational Companies (MNCs) to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. In this study, online questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the current and future hiring trends. The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified.

;Toward Responsible AI: An Overview of Federated Learning for User-centered Privacy-preserving Computing;Yang, Qiang;ACM Trans. Interact. Intell. Syst.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;11;With the rapid advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and applications, an increasing concern is on the development and application of responsible AI technologies. Building AI technologies or machine-learning models often requires massive amounts of data, which may include sensitive, user private information to be collected from different sites or countries. Privacy, security, and data governance constraints rule out a brute force process in the acquisition and integration of these data. It is thus a serious challenge to protect user privacy while achieving high-performance models. This article reviews recent progress of federated learning in addressing this challenge in the context of privacy-preserving computing. Federated learning allows global AI models to be trained and used among multiple decentralized data sources with high security and privacy guarantees, as well as sound incentive mechanisms. This article presents the background, motivations, definitions, architectures, and applications of federated learning as a new paradigm for building privacy-preserving, responsible AI ecosystems.;;10.1145/3485875;https://doi.org/10.1145/3485875;;;Federated learning, responsible AI, decentralized AI, privacy-preserving computing, user privacy, data security, machine learning, blockchain;Association for Computing Machinery;2160-6455;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Multi-technique comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for improving the prediction of teams’ performance;Giannakas, Filippos and Troussas, Christos and Krouska, Akrivi and Sgouropoulou, Cleo and Voyiatzis, Ioannis;Education and Information Technologies;2022;ACM Digital Library;8461–8487;27;Working in groups is an important collaboration activity in the educational context, where a variety of factors can influence the prediction of the teams’ performance. In the pertinent bibliography, several machine learning models are available for delivering predictions. In this sense, the main goal of the current research is to assess 28 different machine learning models, including a Deep Neural Network (DNN) which is structured by 4 hidden layers, for predicting teams’ performance. Additionally, both data analysis and optimization of input data are also explored for their effectiveness in the improvement of the models’ performance. One key finding of the present study is that the XGBoost model succeeded better prediction results, and its precision and robustness were found to be higher, compared to the other models. Additionally, data optimization was shown to be an essential procedure, since the prediction accuracy of all the models, and specifically, that of the XGBoost, improved and found to be 96% during the first phase that of the process, and 94% during the second phase that of the product. Similarly, after applying the hyperparameter tuning and data optimization, the prediction accuracy of the DNN was also improved and found to be 89.94% and 86.16%, during the same two phases. Finally, for interpreting the output of the ML models, in terms of features’ importance, the Shapley Additive Explanations framework (SHAP) was used.;;10.1007/s10639-022-10900-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-10900-4;;;Performance analysis, Comparative analysis, Collaboration, Data optimization, Hyperparameter tuning, Machine learning;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1360-2357;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;DDGCN: graph convolution network based on direction and distance for point cloud learning;Chen, Lifang and Zhang, Qian;Vis. Comput.;2022;ACM Digital Library;863–873;39;Point cloud is usually used to construct the surface shape of three-dimensional geometric objects. Due to the disorder and irregularity of the point cloud, it is still a challenge to fully acquire the semantic features of the point cloud. With the development of graph neural network and graph convolution neural network, researchers are integrating point cloud and graph structure to better represent the semantic features of the point cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional neural network that integrates distance and direction (DDGCN), which constructs a dynamic neighborhood graph by obtaining the similarity matrix of the point cloud, and then uses several multi-layer perceptrons to obtain the local features of the point cloud. For the sake of making the intra-classes in the point cloud data more compact and the spacing between classes larger than the intra-class spacing, we propose a new loss function combined with center loss. The proposed DDGCN has been tested on ModelNet40 dataset, ShapeNet Part dataset and S3DIS dataset, and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation tasks.;;10.1007/s00371-021-02351-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-021-02351-8;;;Point cloud, Deep learning, Similarity matrix, Graph convolutional network;Springer-Verlag;0178-2789;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Enhancing quality of experience in mobile edge computing using deep learning based data offloading and cyberattack detection technique;Hilal, Anwer Mustafa and Alohali, Manal Abdullah and Al-Wesabi, Fahd N. and Nemri, Nadhem and Alyamani, Hasan J. and Gupta, Deepak;Cluster Computing;2021;ACM Digital Library;59–70;26;Due to the advancements of high-speed networks, mobile edge computing (MEC) has received significant attention to bring processing and storage resources in client’s proximity. The MEC is also a form of Edge Network or In-network computing where the resources are brought closer to the user end (edge) of the network while increasing QoE. On the other hand, the increase in the utilization of the internet of things (IoT) gadgets results in the generation of cybersecurity issues. In recent times, the advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques paves way in the detection of existing traffic conditions, data offloading, and cyberattacks in MEC. With this motivation, this study designs an effective deep learning based data offloading and cyberattack detection (DL-DOCAD) technique for MEC. The goal of the DL-DOCAD technique is to enhance the QoE in MEC systems. The proposed DL-DOCAD technique comprises traffic prediction, data offloading, and attack detection. The DL-DOCAD model applies a gated recurrent unit (GRU) based predictive model for traffic detection. In addition, an adaptive sampling cross entropy (ASCE) approach is employed for the maximization of throughput and decision making for offloading users. Moreover, the birds swarm algorithm based feed forward neural network (BSA-FFNN) model is used as a detector for cyberattacks in MEC. The utilization of BSA to appropriately tune the parameters of the FFNN helps to boost the classification performance to a maximum extent. A comprehensive set of simulations are performed and the resultant experimental values highlight the improved performance of the DL-DOCAD technique with the maximum detection accuracy of 0.992.;;10.1007/s10586-021-03401-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03401-5;;;Mobile edge computing, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data offloading, Cyberattack detection, QoE;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1386-7857;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;5G Converged Network Resource Allocation Strategy Based on Reinforcement Learning in Edge Cloud Computing Environment;Li, Xuezhu and Abualigah, Laith;Intell. Neuroscience;2022;ACM Digital Library;;2022;Aiming at the problem that computing power and resources of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers are difficult to process long-period intensive task data, this study proposes a 5G converged network resource allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning in edge cloud computing environment. n order to solve the problem of insufficient local computing power, the proposed strategy offloads some tasks to the edge of network. Firstly, we build a multi-MEC server and multi-user mobile edge system, and design optimization objectives to minimize the average response time of system tasks and total energy consumption. Then, task offloading and resource allocation process is modeled as Markov decision process. Furthermore, the deep Q-network is used to find the optimal resource allocation scheme. Finally, the proposed strategy is analyzed experimentally based on TensorFlow learning framework. Experimental results show that when the number of users is 110, final energy consumption is about 2500 J, which effectively reduces task delay and improves the utilization of resources.;;10.1155/2022/6174708;https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6174708;;;;Hindawi Limited;1687-5265;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

VR methods are also relevant for studies on online learning, especially in groups, as they provide access to a variety of multimodal learning and interaction data. However, VR leads to a trade-off between technological conditions of the observability of such data and the openness of learner behavior. We present Va.Si.Li-Lab, a VR-Lab forSimulation-basedLearning developed to address this trade-off.

;Efficient Online Learning Based Cross-Tier Uplink Scheduling in HetNets;Han, Zhenhua and Tan, Haisheng and Wang, Rui and Hong, Yuncong and Lau, Francis C. M.;IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw.;2022;ACM Digital Library;2389–2402;30;"Heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets), where low-power low-complexity base stations (Pico-BSs) are deployed inside the coverage of macro base stations (Macro-BSs), can significantly improve the spectrum efficiency by Pico- and Macro base station collaboration. Due to cross-tier interference, joint detection of uplink signals is widely adopted so that Pico-BS can either detect the uplink signals locally or forward them to Macro-BS for processing. The latter can achieve increased throughput at the cost of additional backhaul transmission. In this paper, we study the delay-optimal uplink scheduling problem in HetNets with limited backhaul capacity. Local signal detection or joint signal detection is scheduled in a unified delay-optimal framework. Specifically, we first prove that the problem is NP-hard and then formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. We propose an efficient algorithm, called &lt;monospace&gt;OLIUS&lt;/monospace&gt;, that can deal with the exponentially growing state and action space. Furthermore, &lt;monospace&gt;OLIUS&lt;/monospace&gt; is online learning-based which does not require any prior knowledge on user behavior or channel characteristics.

;Rethinking programming “environment”: technical and social environment design toward convivial computing;Kato, Jun and Shimakage, Keisuke;;2020;ACM Digital Library;149–157;;Computers have become ubiquitous in our life and work, and the way that they are built and used needs to be fundamentally improved. Most of the prior effort has been aimed at improving the programming experience for people with specific technical backgrounds (e.g., programmers, end-users, data scientists). In contrast, throughout this paper, we discuss how to make programming activities more inclusive and collaborative, involving people with diverse technical backgrounds. We rethink the programming environment from both technical and social perspectives. First, we briefly introduce our previous technical effort in which the programming environment is shared between the developers and users of programs, eliminating the distinction between programming and runtime environments and fostering communication between them. Second, we introduce our social effort to support people who are visually impaired in implementing customized smart glasses that read words with a camera and speakers. We design their programming environment to consist of a softwarehardware toolkit and engineers with domain expertise called “evangelists.” Learning from these experiences, we discuss several perspectives on convivial computing. To conclude, we argue that both technical innovations made on user interfaces for programming and understanding on the socio-technical aspect of domain-specific applications are critical for the future of programming environments, and accordingly, convivial computing.;;10.1145/3397537.3397544;https://doi.org/10.1145/3397537.3397544;;;convivial computing, live programming, programming environments, programming experience, social coding;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Developers often refer to online resources to find inspiration or answers to questions they have about mobile programming topics and screencasts are a popular resource. However, given the multitude of screencasts available, it can be difficult to quickly comprehend which of the many videos is relevant to one's needs.We propose a novel approach, called UIScreens, which detects, extracts, and presents the most representative user interface (UI) screens embedded in mobile development screencasts. This could help developers quickly comprehend what an app displayed in a video is about, therefore saving time searching for useful videos.UIScreens has been evaluated in two empirical studies on iOS and Android programming screencasts. The first study investigates the accuracy of our UI extraction and shows that our approach is able to detect and extract UI screens with an accuracy of 94%. The second is a user study with mobile app developers, who evaluated both the accuracy and the usefulness of UIScreens. They agreed that UIScreens is accurate and extracts representative UI screens from videos. They considered that the extracted UI screens are useful for understanding what a video is about and if it is relevant to a search.

;Can My WiFi Handle the Metaverse? A Performance Evaluation Of Meta's Flagship Virtual Reality Hardware;Jansen, Matthijs and Donkervliet, Jesse and Trivedi, Animesh and Iosup, Alexandru;;2023;ACM Digital Library;297–303;;Extending human societies into virtual space through the construction of a metaverse has been a long-term challenge in both industry and academia. Achieving this challenge is now closer than ever due to advances in computer systems, facilitating large-scale online platforms such as Minecraft and Roblox that fulfill an increasing number of societal needs, and extended reality (XR) hardware, which provides users with state-of-the-art immersive experiences. For a metaverse to succeed, we argue that all involved systems must provide consistently good performance. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the performance characteristics of extended reality devices. In this paper, we address this gap and focus on extended- and virtual-reality hardware. We synthesize a user-centered system model that models common deployments of XR hardware and their trade-offs. Based on this model, we design and conduct real-world experiments with Meta's flagship virtual reality device, the Quest Pro. We highlight two surprising results from our findings which show that (i) under our workload, the battery drains 15% faster when using wireless offloading compared to local execution, and (ii) the outdated 2.4 GHz WiFi4 gives surprisingly good performance, with 99% of samples achieving a frame rate of at least 65 Hz, compared to the 72 Hz performance target.

However, we have limited knowledge of how computing professional identity develops. This paper aims to understand how CS undergraduate students develop their professional identity through analyzing students' reflection on their career goals, experiences in CS degree programs, and engagement in professional development. We present findings from qualitative analysis of 14 semi-structured interviews with CS undergraduate students in the United States. We found that CS undergraduates form their computing professional identity typically between Years 2-3 of their degree programs. We identified several reasons students are committed to a computing profession: intrinsic factors (e.g., interest and perception of ability), and discipline-specific factors (e.g. utility and growth). We also found several factors that shape their professional identity: coursework, informal activities like hackathons, and professional development activities including internships and conferences. These findings suggest that the development of computing professional identity is not limited to students' involvement in the academic degree programs but the engagement they have with the broader computing community.;;10.1145/3304221.3319764;https://doi.org/10.1145/3304221.3319764;;;career choices, identity, professional development, professional identity;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Performance characteristics, however, depend on a complex combination of storage format, machine capabilities, and choices in code-generation. A deep understanding of the relative impact of these properties is important in itself, and also to better understanding the performance potential of alternative execution contexts such as web-based scientific computing, where the recent introduction ofWebAssembly offers the potential for low-level, near-native performance within a web browser. In this work we characterize the performance of SpMV operations for different sparse storage formats based on the sparse matrix structure and the machine architecture. We extract structural properties from 2000 real-life sparse matrices to understand their impact on the choice of storage format and also on the performance within those storage formats for both WebAssembly and native C. We extend this with new matrix features based on a ""reuse-distance"" concept to identify performance bottlenecks, and evaluate the effect of interaction between the matrix structure and hardware characteristics on SpMV performance.

;Silhouette Pose Feature-Based Human Action Classification Using Capsule Network;Saif, A. F. M. Saifuddin and Khan, Md. Akib Shahriar and Hadi, Abir Mohammad and Karmoker, Rahul Proshad and Gomes, Joy Julian;J. Inf. Technol. Res.;2021;ACM Digital Library;106–124;14;Recent years have seen a rise in the use of various machine learning techniques in computer vision, particularly in posing feature-based human action recognition which includes convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). CNN-based methods are useful in recognizing human actions for combined motions (i.e., standing up, hand shaking, walking). However, in case of uncertainty of camera motion, occlusion, and multiple people, CNN suppresses important feature information and is not efficient enough to recognize variations for human action. Besides, RNN with long short-term memory (LSTM) requires more computational power to retain memories to classify human actions. This research proposes an extended framework based on capsule network using silhouette pose features to recognize human actions. Proposed extended framework achieved high accuracy of 95.64% which is higher than previous research methodology. Extensive experimental validation of the proposed extended framework reveals efficiency which is expected to contribute significantly in action recognition research.;;10.4018/JITR.2021040106;https://doi.org/10.4018/JITR.2021040106;;;Action Classification, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Image Processing, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition;IGI Global;1938-7857;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A family of software product lines in educational technologies;Chimalakonda, Sridhar and Nori, Kesav V.;Computing;2020;ACM Digital Library;1765–1792;102;Rapid advances in education domain demand the design and customization of educational technologies for a large scale and variety of evolving requirements. Here, scale is the number of systems to be developed and variety stems from a diversified range of instructional designs such as varied goals, processes, content, teaching styles, learning styles and, also for eLearning Systems for 22 Indian Languages and variants. In this paper, we present a family of software product lines as an approach to address this challenge of modeling a family of instructional designs as well as a family of eLearning Systems and demonstrate it for the case of adult literacy in India (287 million learners). We present a multi-level product line that connects product lines at multiple levels of granularity in education domain. We then detail two concrete product lines (), one that generates instructional design editors and two, which generates a family of eLearning Systems based on flexible instructional designs. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by generating eLearning Systems for Hindi and Telugu languages, which led to significant cost savings of 29 person-months for 9 eLearning Systems.;;10.1007/s00607-019-00772-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00607-019-00772-x;;;Software product lines, Educational technologies, Instructional design, eLearning Systems, Adult literacy, 68N19, 68N30, 68U35, 68T30, 97B60;Springer-Verlag;0010-485X;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A mixed reality framework for microsurgery simulation with visual-tactile perception;Xiang, Nan and Liang, Hai-Ning and Yu, Lingyun and Yang, Xiaosong and Zhang, Jian J.;Vis. Comput.;2023;ACM Digital Library;3661–3673;39;Microsurgery is a general term for surgery combining surgical microscope and specialized precision instruments during operation. Training in microsurgery requires considerable time and training resources. With the rapid development of computer technologies, virtual surgery simulation has gained extensive attention over the past decades. In this work, we take advantage of mixed reality (MR) that creates an interactive environment where physical and digital objects coexist, and present an MR framework for the microsurgery simulation. It enables users to practice anastomosis skills with real microsurgical instruments rather than additional haptic feedback devices that are typically used in virtual reality-based systems, and to view a realistic rendering intra-operative scene at the same time, thus creating an immersive training experience with such a visual-tactile interactive environment. A vision-based tracking system is proposed to simultaneously track microsurgical instruments and artificial blood vessels, and a learning-based anatomical modeling approach is introduced to facilitate the development of simulations in different microsurgical specialities by rapidly creating virtual assets. Moreover, we build a prototype system for the simulation specializing in microvascular hepatic artery reconstruction to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of our framework.;;10.1007/s00371-023-02964-1;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-023-02964-1;;;Virtual surgery, Mixed reality, 3D tracking, 3D modeling;Springer-Verlag;0178-2789;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Moreover, the high cost of breakdowns invests in a maintenance strategy, one of the most critical aspects of a manufacturing system. In the digital age, e-maintenance platforms can interoperate technically but fail to achieve semantic interoperability. The results are ambiguities and misunderstandings that can lead to equipment shutdowns or inefficient use of material resources. However, as formal knowledge specifications, ontologies have successfully integrated heterogeneous systems for some time. Therefore, the authors developed a core industrial maintenance ontology that is both generic and capable of extending and refining to meet semantic information repository requirements. Ontologies can unite and merge different datasets without adapting new ontologies. Only the core ontology needs to be modified according to the new semantics. A detailed description of the development process is provided, beginning with the definition of requirements and ending with the evaluation.;;10.4018/IJSSCI.312555;https://doi.org/10.4018/IJSSCI.312555;;;Domain Ontology, Industrial Maintenance, Maintenance Ontologies, Ontological Engineering;IGI Global;1942-9045;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Exploring the transformation of user interactions to Adaptive Human-Machine Interfaces;Carrera-Rivera, Angela and Reguera-Bakhache, Daniel and Larrinaga, Felix and Lasa, Ganix;;2024;ACM Digital Library;;;Human-machine interfaces (HMI) facilitate communication between humans and machines, and their importance has increased in modern technology. However, traditional HMIs are often static and do not adapt to individual user preferences or behavior. Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) have become increasingly important in providing personalized user experiences. Machine learning techniques have gained traction in User Experience (UX) research to provide smart adaptations that can reduce user cognitive load. This paper presents an ongoing exploration of a method for generating adaptive user interfaces by analyzing user interactions and contextual data. It also provides an illustrative example using Markov chains to predict the next step for users interacting with an app for an industrial mixing machine. Furthermore, the paper conducts an offline evaluation of the approach, focusing on the precision of the recommendations. The study emphasizes the importance of incorporating user interactions and contextual data into the design of adaptive HMIs, while acknowledging the existing challenges and potential benefits.;;10.1145/3612783.3612807;https://doi.org/10.1145/3612783.3612807;;;Adaptive user interfaces, HMI, recommendation systems;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Usability of data-oriented user interfaces for cultural heritage: A systematic mapping study;Diulio, Maria de la Paz and Gardey, Juan Cruz and Gomez, Anal\'{\i}a Fernanda and Garrido, Alejandra;J.

In these applications, large amounts of data need to be wisely presented to help final users at drawing conclusions and making decisions. While sophisticated technology may be used to improve the user experience, it should not be applied to the detriment of usability, which is critical for the success of these applications. We performed a systematic mapping study to classify the literature retrieved in the four largest scientific databases by a structured search string. We classify applications according to purpose, intended users, the way they address and evaluate user experience and usability, among others, and include the analysis of combined results through maps. Findings reveal the contradiction that while most articles are intended for the education and tourism of the general public, only half of the studies evaluate usability. Moreover, there is a significant research gap in user interfaces for systems in the context of preventive conservation, for research, assessment and decision assistance. This is the first systematic mapping study combining usability and cultural heritage, especially for data-oriented applications. It shows that more research is necessary to assist conservators and researchers and to address usability from early stages of development.;;10.1177/01655515211001787;https://doi.org/10.1177/01655515211001787;;;Data-intensive applications, preventive conservation, usability, user experience, web applications;Sage Publications, Inc.;0165-5515;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Comparative Study of Adversarial Training Methods for Cold-Start Recommendation;Ma, Haokai and Li, Xiangxian and Meng, Lei and Meng, Xiangxu;;2021;ACM Digital Library;28–34;;Adversarial training in recommendation is originated to improve the robustness of recommenders to attack signals and has recently shown promising results to alleviate cold-start recommendation. However, existing methods usually should make a trade-off between model robustness and performance, and the underlying reasons why using adversarial samples for training works has not been sufficiently verified. To address this issue, this paper identifies the key components of existing adversarial training methods and presents a taxonomy that defines these methods using three levels of components for perturbation generation, perturbation incorporation, and model optimization. Based on this taxonomy, different variants of existing methods are created, and a comparative study is conducted to verify the influence of each component in cold-start recommendation. Experimental results on two benchmarking datasets show that existing state-of-the-art algorithms can be further improved by a proper pairing of the key components as listed in the taxonomy. Moreover, using case studies and visualization, the influence of the content information of items on cold-start recommendation has been analyzed, and the explanations for the working mechanism of different components as proposed in the taxonomy have been offered. These verify the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy as a design paradigm for adversarial training.;;10.1145/3475724.3483600;https://doi.org/10.1145/3475724.3483600;;;adversarial training, cold-start recommendation, taxonomy;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This handwriting disorder is mainly observed among 10%-40% of school children. In present scenario, dysgraphia is diagnosed by the medical practitioners by analysing the person's written document and staff's impressions. Such diagnosis mechanism is very time consuming and may result in the undiagnosed dysgraphia when a child is having mild symptoms.

The strain on emergency call systems estimated by a 9 million calls (including both landline and mobile) made in 2014 alone. Coupled with an increasing population and cuts in government funding, this has resulted in lower percentages of emergency response vehicles at hand and longer response times. In this paper, we highlight the main challenges of emergency services and overview of previous solutions. In addition, we propose a new system call Smart Hospital Emergency System (SHES). The main aim of SHES is to save lives through improving communications between patient and emergency services. Utilising the latest of technologies and algorithms within SHES is aiming to increase emergency communication throughput, while reducing emergency call systems issues and making the process of emergency response more efficient. Utilising health data held within a personal smartphone, and internal tracked data (GPU, Accelerometer, Gyroscope etc.), SHES aims to process the mentioned data efficiently, and securely, through automatic communications with emergency services, ultimately reducing communication bottlenecks. Live video-streaming through real-time video communication protocols is also a focus of SHES to improve initial communications between emergency services and patients.

Recent advances in brain sensing technologies, new analysis methods, and hardware improvements have opened the door for such research, which will accelerate with the increased commercialization of wearable technology containing brain sensors. In this monograph, we examine brain signals from an HCI perspective, focusing on work that makes an HCI-related contribution. We pursue three main goals. First, we give a primer for HCI researchers on the necessary technology, the possibilities, and limitations for using brain signals in user interfaces. Second, we systematically map out the research field by constructing a taxonomy of applications, input paradigms, and interface designs. For this purpose, we reviewed more than 100 publications in major HCI conferences and journals. Finally, we identify gaps and areas of emerging work to lay a foundation for future research on HCI for and with brain signals.;;10.1561/1100000078;https://doi.org/10.1561/1100000078;;;;Now Publishers Inc.;1551-3955;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Different from traditional co-word network analysis, KCK network highlights the importance of keywords assigned in different articles, as well as the semantic relationship between keywords in various articles. In this study, we select computer science domain as an example to illustrate the proposed method. Meanwhile, the results of network analysis, PageRank analysis, and research topic analysis are compared with those of traditional co-word analysis.

;Human gait assessment using a 3D marker-less multimodal motion capture system;Rodrigues, Thiago Braga and Salgado, Debora Pereira and Cath\'{a}in, Ciar\'{a}n \'{O} and O’Connor, Noel and Murray, Niall;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2020;ACM Digital Library;2629–2651;79;"Gait analysis is the measurement, processing and systematic interpretation of biomechanical parameters that characterize human locomotion. It supports the identification of movement limitations and development of rehabilitation procedures. Accurate Gait analysis is important in sports analysis, medical field, and rehabilitation. Although Gait analysis is performed in several laboratories in many countries, there are many issues such as: (i) the high cost of precise Motion Capture systems; (ii) the scarcity of qualified personnel to operate them; (iii) expertise required to interpret their results; (iv) space requirements to install and store these systems; as well as difficulties related to the measurement protocols of each system; (vi) limited availability (vii) and the use of markers can be a barrier for some clinical use cases (e.g. patients recovering from orthopedics surgeries). In this work, we present a low cost and more accessible system based on the integration of a Multiple Microsoft Kinect sensors and multiple Shimmer inertial sensors to capture human Gait. The novel multimodal system combines data from inertial and 3D depth cameras and outputs spatiotemporal Gait variables. A comparison of this system with the VICON system (the gold standard in Motion Capture) was performed. Our relatively low-cost marker-less multimodal motion generates a complete 360-degree skeleton view. We compare our system with the VICON via gait spatiotemporal variables: Gait cycle time, stride time, Gait length (distance between two strides), stride length, and velocity. The system was also evaluated with knee and hip joint angles measurement accuracy. The results show high correlation for spatiotemporal variables and joint angles inside the 95% bootstrap prediction when compared with VICON.";;10.1007/s11042-019-08275-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-019-08275-9;;;3D model, Gait analysis, Motion capture, Multimodal sensors;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A functional and semantic analysis of artifact representation schemata in folklore museum websites;Maratsi, Maria Ioanna and Lachana, Zoi and Alexopoulos, Charalampos and Charalabidis, Yannis;Int. J. Metadata Semant. Ontologies;2023;ACM Digital Library;105–117;16;Folklore culture is the summary and embodiment of a way of life, a normative form for people, covering local life in rural communities. A folklore museum typically displays historical objects used as part of people's everyday lives. The representation of information in the digital realm is an important aspect of cultural heritage institutions, with museums taking over a considerable proportion. Having taken into consideration requirements set by the existing literature and examining relevant research and approaches, the authors developed an analysis framework including 16 popular folklore museums around the world, in order to examine various aspects of their digital presence. More specifically, the authors followed a two-fold methodological approach conducting a functionality and semantic analysis of the chosen museums with the purpose of determining the current approaches and tendencies with respect to representation schemata for folklore museum artifacts and their digital representation.;;10.1504/ijmso.2023.135339;https://doi.org/10.1504/ijmso.2023.135339;;;semantics, LOD, linked open data, vocabularies, interoperability, folklore museums, cultural heritage, semantic interoperability, metadata schema;Inderscience Publishers;1744-2621;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Designing systems for mobile collaboration;Seidel, Niels;;2022;ACM Digital Library;;;Due to the widespread use of mobile communication devices, the mobility in everyday life including mobile working habits, a variety of collaborative software applications accompany us every day. In this paper, we aim to capture and describe the essence of the design solutions implemented in these applications in the terms of design patterns. To achieve this goal, we examined relevant services and applications in literature that enable people to collaborate on the go. Furthermore, the geographic characteristics of place, space, and mobility are discussed with regard to location-based collaboration including references to the theory of relativity. As result 11 design patterns for mobile collaboration have been elaborated. The design patterns describe, in addition to basic technologies, generic map services and privacy preserving solutions. In particular the patterns Geo Fencing, Locale Me, Geo Tracing, and Substitute Position are presented in detail. These patterns are intended to guide computer science teachers and software developers on how to design mobile collaboration systems that mediate collaboration in physical space through interactions in virtual space.;;10.1145/3489449.3489999;https://doi.org/10.1145/3489449.3489999;;;CSCW, Design Patterns, Mobile Collaboration, Mobile Interaction;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Remote health monitoring of elderly through wearable sensors;Al-khafajiy, Mohammed and Baker, Thar and Chalmers, Carl and Asim, Muhammad and Kolivand, Hoshang and Fahim, Muhammad and Waraich, Atif;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2019;ACM Digital Library;24681–24706;78;Due to a rapidly increasing aging population and its associated challenges in health and social care, Ambient Assistive Living has become the focal point for both researchers and industry alike. The need to manage or even reduce healthcare costs while improving the quality of service is high government agendas. Although, technology has a major role to play in achieving these aspirations, any solution must be designed, implemented and validated using appropriate domain knowledge. In order to overcome these challenges, the remote real-time monitoring of a person’s health can be used to identify relapses in conditions, therefore, enabling early intervention. Thus, the development of a smart healthcare monitoring system, which is capable of observing elderly people remotely, is the focus of the research presented in this paper. The technology outlined in this paper focuses on the ability to track a person’s physiological data to detect specific disorders which can aid in Early Intervention Practices. This is achieved by accurately processing and analysing the acquired sensory data while transmitting the detection of a disorder to an appropriate career. The finding reveals that the proposed system can improve clinical decision supports while facilitating Early Intervention Practices. Our extensive simulation results indicate a superior performance of the proposed system: low latency (96% of the packets are received with less than 1 millisecond) and low packets-lost (only 2.2% of total packets are dropped). Thus, the system runs efficiently and is cost-effective in terms of data acquisition and manipulation.;;10.1007/s11042-018-7134-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-018-7134-7;;;Internet of things, Ambient assisted living, Healthcare, Sensor network, Real-time monitoring, Wireless sensor networks;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;PointCRT: Detecting Backdoor in 3D Point Cloud via Corruption Robustness;Hu, Shengshan and Liu, Wei and Li, Minghui and Zhang, Yechao and Liu, Xiaogeng and Wang, Xianlong and Zhang, Leo Yu and Hou, Junhui;;2023;ACM Digital Library;666–675;;Backdoor attacks for point clouds have elicited mounting interest with the proliferation of deep learning. The point cloud classifiers can be vulnerable to malicious actors who seek to manipulate or fool the model with specific backdoor triggers. Detecting and rejecting backdoor samples during the inference stage can effectively alleviate backdoor attacks. Recently, some black-box test-time backdoor sample detection methods have been proposed in the 2D image domain, without any underlying assumptions about the backdoor triggers. However, upon examination, we have found that these detection techniques are not effective for 3D point clouds. As a result, there is a pressing need to bridge the gap for the development of a universal approach that is specifically designed for 3D point clouds.In this paper, we propose the first test-time backdoor sample detection method in 3D point cloud without assumption to the backdoor triggers, called Point Clouds Corruption Robustness Test (PointCRT). Based on the fact that the corruption robustness of clean samples remains relatively stable across various backdoor models, we propose the corruption robustness score to map the features into high-dimensional space. The corruption robustness score is a vector evaluated by label consistency, whose element is the minimum severity level of corruption that changes the label prediction of the victim model. Then, the trigger is identified by detecting the abnormal corruption robustness score through a nonlinear classification. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate PointCRT deals with all cases with the average AUC over 0.934 and F1 score over 0.864, with the enhancement of 18%-28% on ModelNet40.

;cDeepArch: A Compact Deep Neural Network Architecture for Mobile Sensing;Yang, Kang and Xing, Tianzhang and Liu, Yang and Li, Zhenjiang and Gong, Xiaoqing and Chen, Xiaojiang and Fang, Dingyi;IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw.;2019;ACM Digital Library;2043–2055;27;Mobile sensing is a promising sensing paradigm in the era of Internet of Things IoT that utilizes mobile device sensors to collect sensory data about sensing targets and further applies learning techniques to recognize the sensed targets to correct classes or categories. Due to the recent great success of deep learning, an emerging trend is to adopt deep learning in this recognition process, while we find an overlooked yet crucial issue to be solved in this paper — The size of deep learning models should be sufficiently large for reliably classifying various types of recognition targets, while the achieved processing delay may fail to satisfy the stringent latency requirement from applications. If we blindly shrink the deep learning model for acceleration, the performance cannot be guaranteed. To cope with this challenge, this paper presents a compact deep neural network architecture, namely cDeepArch. The key idea of the cDeepArch design is to decompose the entire recognition task into two lightweight sub-problems: context recognition and the context-oriented target recognitions. This decomposition essentially utilizes the adequate storage to trade for the CPU and memory resource consumptions during execution. In addition, we further formulate the execution latency for decomposed deep learning models and propose a set of enhancement techniques, so that system performance and resource consumption can be quantitatively balanced. We implement a cDeepArch prototype system and conduct extensive experiments. The result shows that cDeepArch achieves excellent recognition performance and the execution latency is also lightweight.;;10.1109/TNET.2019.2936939;https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2019.2936939;;;;IEEE Press;1063-6692;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Task Modelling for Interactive System Design: A Survey of Historical Trends, Gaps and Future Needs;Bowen, Judy and Dittmar, Anke and Weyers, Benjamin;Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;5;Task models have been used for decades in interactive system design and there are several mature modelling approaches with corresponding tool support. However, in our own work, we have also experienced their limitations, especially in situations where task models are partial ancillary models and not primary artifacts. This was one of the motivations for this paper, which presents a systematic examination of literature to better understand the current place of task models in the continual evolution of user-centred software development practices. While overview work in this domain typically focuses on the analysis of representative task modelling notations and/or tools and relies on foundation papers, we apply a mixed top-down and bottom-up approach to identify relevant themes and trends in the use of task models over the last twenty-years. The paper identifies and discusses dominant patterns of use as well as gaps. It provides a comprehensive framing of both past and present trends in task modelling and supports those who want to incorporate task modelling in their own work. From this we identify areas of research that should receive greater attention in order to address future considerations.;;10.1145/3461736;https://doi.org/10.1145/3461736;;;interactive system design, task analysis, task models, task-based design;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Analysis Method of App Software User Experience Based on Multisource Information Fusion;Jiang, Ying and Liu, Haiyi and Chen, Yongquan;Int. J. Semant. Web Inf. Syst.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1–22;19;With the rapid development and popularization of intelligent terminals, app software has also developed rapidly. The research and practical value of mining user experience (UX) of app software form interaction information are becoming increasingly prominent. The interactive information of app software is multisource homogeneous and heterogeneous. In order to obtain more accurate and more comprehensive app software UX results, the fused multisource information should be analyzed. In this paper, the app software UX analysis method based on multisource information fusion is proposed. First, feature engineering is carried out to extract the features. Then, the feature combination tree is constructed after feature correlation mining. Finally, the multisource app software interactive data are fused, and the result is further analyzed to obtain the information of app software UX. The experiments clearly show that the method can effectively fuse multisource app software interaction data and help to comprehensively mine the app software UX embodied in the data.;;10.4018/IJSWIS.325216;https://doi.org/10.4018/IJSWIS.325216;;;App Software, Interactive Information of App Software, Multisource Information Fusion, User Experience;IGI Global;1552-6283;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;About the Author and the Collaborator/Index;;;2024;ACM Digital Library;;;This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past.

;Disaster Ergonomics: a Human Factors approach to address escalating challenges from disasters;Son, Changwon;Cogn. Technol. Work;2023;ACM Digital Library;325–344;25;Recent disasters occurring as natural events, industrial incidents, and public health crises, impose unprecedented challenges to humans and communities. Increasing uncertainty and complexity of disasters require multidisciplinary research efforts due to various elements involved in a disaster management system (DMS). Despite the growing body of knowledge regarding disasters, an Ergonomics approach toward the DMS is still limited. To address such a research gap, the current paper presents a Disaster Ergonomics framework that incorporates three essential system elements: demands from a disaster, strategies of responders and response organizations to satisfy the demands, and disaster tools and technologies to bridge the demands and the strategies. Especially, the framework is built upon three pillars of the DMS: resource management, command and coordination, and information and communication. As a form of simple validation, an analysis of 2017 Hurricane Harvey was conducted in line with the framework. Recommended future research topics and directions for full validation of the Disaster Ergonomics framework are also discussed.;;10.1007/s10111-023-00736-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10111-023-00736-4;;;Emergency response, Disaster management, Human factors, Ergonomics, Resilience engineering;Springer-Verlag;1435-5558;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This precision in capturing gaze direction has made eye-tracking instrumental for applications far beyond mere interaction, influencing areas like medical diagnostics, neuroscientific research, educational interventions, and architectural design, to name a few. Though eye-tracking’s integration into VR has been acknowledged in prior reviews, its true depth, spanning the intricacies of its deployment to its broader ramifications across diverse sectors, has been sparsely explored. This survey undertakes that endeavor, offering a comprehensive overview of eye-tracking’s state of the art within the VR landscape. We delve into its technological nuances, its pivotal role in modern VR applications, and its transformative impact on domains ranging from medicine and neuroscience to marketing and education.

;A SEM-STELLA approach for predicting decision-makers’ adoption of cloud computing data center;Badie, Nasrin and Hussin, Ab Razak Che and Yadegaridehkordi, Elaheh and Singh, Dalbir and Lashkari, Arash Habibi;Education and Information Technologies;2022;ACM Digital Library;8219–8271;28;Cloud computing is the next generation of on-demand information technology services and products that deliver various applications over the Internet. Cloud computing is often adopted as a superior alternative by data centers to replace their current system. However, cloud computing services are still accompanied by many issues which hinder their adoption in data centers. Therefore, this study proposed a Cloud Computing Data Center (CCDC) adoption model for administration activities in higher education institutions. Technology Organization Environment (TOE), Diffusion of Innovation theory (DOI), and Institutional theory were considered as theoretical bases of CCDC model. A new Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)-STELLA method was applied to examine the proposed model and simulate it like a real system to investigate the respondents' interest in adopting cloud by passing the time. A questionnaire instrument was designed, and data were collected from 204 decision-makers at Malaysian universities. The results showed that eight out of ten factors, namely relative advantage, Complexity, compatibility, top management support, policy and standardization, competitive pressure, outage, and security influenced CCDC adoption. Finally, STELLA simulated the value changing of some factors or sub factors on the level of interest in adopting CCDC. Results showed that security and policy play the highest influence on the adoption of cloud computing. This research contributes to a theoretical understanding of factors that influence CCDC adoption. Meanwhile, it provides a better understanding of changes in users' behavior during the adoption of cloud computing services.;;10.1007/s10639-022-11484-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-11484-9;;;Cloud computing adoption, Data center, Structural Equation Modelling, STELLA;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1360-2357;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

In this work, a system called NLP-Theatre is presented, with the emphasis given to its technical aspects relevant to the problem of DHH inclusivity. The leading concept behind this system’s functioning is the automatic real-time extraction of the actors’ speech transcripts and their matching to a pre-arranged set of subtitles that correspond to the theater script at hand. The matching accuracy scores indicate the correct timings for the display of each subtitle to the audience during a live performance and the concurrent activation of several other events that render possible the synchronization of multiple streams of information directed towards the spectators. One such stream is also the video of sign language interpretation that is also synchronized in real-time with the live performance and mainly targets DHH individuals. A subjective evaluation of the subtitles and sign language streams is presented based on questionnaire responses provided by the guests in an experimental theater show. Furthermore, purely technical experiments were run, centered around the performance assessment of the Speech-To-Text (STT) alternatives that are employed in the system, that is both a commercial general-purpose remote solution and a custom ASR service. The latter employs a script-specific TDNN-HMM model that runs locally and is created using a Language Model (LM) adaptation strategy.;;10.1145/3529190.3534770;https://doi.org/10.1145/3529190.3534770;;;LM adaptation, STT model, sign language video synchronization, subtitles alignment;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;RC-Net: Row and Column Network with Text Feature for Parsing Floor Plan Images;Wang, Teng and Meng, Wei-Liang and Lu, Zheng-Da and Guo, Jian-Wei and Xiao, Jun and Zhang, Xiao-Peng;J. Comput. Sci. Technol.;2023;ACM Digital Library;526–539;38;The popularity of online home design and floor plan customization has been steadily increasing. However, the manual conversion of floor plan images from books or paper materials into electronic resources can be a challenging task due to the vast amount of historical data available. By leveraging neural networks to identify and parse floor plans, the process of converting these images into electronic materials can be significantly streamlined. In this paper, we present a novel learning framework for automatically parsing floor plan images. Our key insight is that the room type text is very common and crucial in floor plan images as it identifies the important semantic information of the corresponding room. However, this clue is rarely considered in previous learning-based methods. In contrast, we propose the Row and Column network (RC-Net) for recognizing floor plan elements by integrating the text feature. Specifically, we add the text feature branch in the network to extract text features corresponding to the room type for the guidance of room type predictions. More importantly, we formulate the Row and Column constraint module (RC constraint module) to share and constrain features across the entire row and column of the feature maps to ensure that only one type is predicted in each room as much as possible, making the segmentation boundaries between different rooms more regular and cleaner. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate that our framework substantially outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the metrics of FWIoU, mACC and mIoU.;;10.1007/s11390-023-3117-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-023-3117-x;;;floor plan understanding, text feature, Row and Column (RC) constraint module, Row and Column network (RC-Net);Springer-Verlag;1000-9000;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Exploring Sonification Mapping Strategies for Spatial Auditory Guidance in Immersive Virtual Environments;Gao, Zihan and Wang, Huiqiang and Feng, Guangsheng and Lv, Hongwu;ACM Trans. Appl. Percept.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;19;Spatial auditory cues are important for many tasks in immersive virtual environments, especially guidance tasks. However, due to the limited fidelity of spatial sounds rendered by generic Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), sound localization usually has a limited accuracy, especially in elevation, which can potentially impact the effectiveness of auditory guidance. To address this issue, we explored whether integrating sonification with spatial audio can enhance the perceptions of auditory guidance cues so user performance in auditory guidance tasks can be improved. Specifically, we investigated the effects of sonification mapping strategy using a controlled experiment that compared four elevation sonification mapping strategies: absolute elevation mapping, unsigned relative elevation mapping, signed relative elevation mapping, and binary relative elevation mapping. In addition, we examined whether azimuth sonification mapping can further benefit the perception of spatial sounds. The results demonstrate that spatial auditory cues can be effectively enhanced by integrating elevation and azimuth sonification, where the accuracy and speed of guidance tasks can be significantly improved. In particular, the overall results suggest that binary relative elevation mapping is generally the most effective strategy among four elevation sonification mapping strategies, which indicates that auditory cues with clear directional information are key to efficient auditory guidance.;;10.1145/3528171;https://doi.org/10.1145/3528171;;;Auditory user interface, non-visual guidance, interactive sonification, spatial audio, 3D sound, auditory feedback;Association for Computing Machinery;1544-3558;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation by Digging into Uncertainty Quantification;Li, Yuan-Zhen and Zheng, Sheng-Jie and Tan, Zi-Xin and Cao, Tuo and Luo, Fei and Xiao, Chun-Xia;J. Comput. Sci. Technol.;2023;ACM Digital Library;510–525;38;Based on well-designed network architectures and objective functions, self-supervised monocular depth estimation has made great progress. However, lacking a specific mechanism to make the network learn more about the regions containing moving objects or occlusion scenarios, existing depth estimation methods likely produce poor results for them. Therefore, we propose an uncertainty quantification method to improve the performance of existing depth estimation networks without changing their architectures. Our uncertainty quantification method consists of uncertainty measurement, the learning guidance by uncertainty, and the ultimate adaptive determination. Firstly, with Snapshot and Siam learning strategies, we measure the uncertainty degree by calculating the variance of pre-converged epochs or twins during training. Secondly, we use the uncertainty to guide the network to strengthen learning about those regions with more uncertainty. Finally, we use the uncertainty to adaptively produce the final depth estimation results with a balance of accuracy and robustness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our uncertainty quantification method, we apply it to two state-of-the-art models, Monodepth2 and Hints. Experimental results show that our method has improved the depth estimation performance in seven evaluation metrics compared with two baseline models and exceeded the existing uncertainty method.;;10.1007/s11390-023-3088-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-023-3088-y;;;self-supervised, monocular depth estimation, uncertainty quantification, variance;Springer-Verlag;1000-9000;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Virtual Reality Aided High-Quality 3D Reconstruction by Remote Drones;Zhang, Di and Xu, Feng and Pun, Chi-Man and Yang, Yang and Lan, Rushi and Wang, Liejun and Li, Yujie and Gao, Hao;ACM Trans. Internet Technol.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;22;Artificial intelligence including deep learning and 3D reconstruction methods is changing the daily life of people. Now, an unmanned aerial vehicle that can move freely in the air and avoid harsh ground conditions has been commonly adopted as a suitable tool for 3D reconstruction. The traditional 3D reconstruction mission based on drones usually consists of two steps: image collection and offline post-processing. But there are two problems: one is the uncertainty of whether all parts of the target object are covered, and another is the tedious post-processing time. Inspired by modern deep learning methods, we build a telexistence drone system with an onboard deep learning computation module and a wireless data transmission module that perform incremental real-time dense reconstruction of urban cities by itself. Two technical contributions are proposed to solve the preceding issues. First, based on the popular depth fusion surface reconstruction framework, we combine it with a visual-inertial odometry estimator that integrates the inertial measurement unit and allows for robust camera tracking as well as high-accuracy online 3D scan. Second, the capability of real-time 3D reconstruction enables a new rendering technique that can visualize the reconstructed geometry of the target as navigation guidance in the HMD. Therefore, it turns the traditional path-planning-based modeling process into an interactive one, leading to a higher level of scan completeness. The experiments in the simulation system and our real prototype demonstrate an improved quality of the 3D model using our artificial intelligence leveraged drone system.;;10.1145/3458930;https://doi.org/10.1145/3458930;;;3D reconstruction, virtual reality, unmanned aerial vehicle, telexistence, human-robot-interaction;Association for Computing Machinery;1533-5399;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A fuzzy approach for optimal placement of IoT applications in fog-cloud computing;Tavousi, Farhad and Azizi, Sadoon and Ghaderzadeh, Abdulbaghi;Cluster Computing;2022;ACM Digital Library;303–320;25;Fog-cloud computing is a promising distributed model for hosting ever-increasing Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IoT applications should meet different characteristics such as deadline, frequency rate, and input file size. Fog nodes are heterogeneous, resource-limited devices and cannot accommodate all the IoT applications. Due to these difficulties, designing an efficient algorithm to deploy a set of IoT applications in a fog-cloud environment is very important. In this paper, a fuzzy approach is developed to classify applications based on their characteristics then an efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed to place applications on the virtualized computing resources. The proposed policy aims to provide a high quality of service for IoT users while the profit of fog service providers is maximized by minimizing resource wastage. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed policy. Results show that the proposed policy outperforms other approaches by improving the average response time up to 13%, the percentage of deadline satisfied requests up to 12%, and the resource wastage up to 26%.;;10.1007/s10586-021-03406-0;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03406-0;;;Fog-cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Application placement, Fuzzy approach, Quality of service (QoS), Resource wastage;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1386-7857;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly;Caporuscio, Mauro and D’Angelo, Mirko and Grassi, Vincenzo and Mirandola, Raffaela;;2020;ACM Digital Library;57–72;;Contemporary application domains make more and more appealing the vision of applications built as a dynamic and opportunistic assembly of autonomous and independent resources. However, the adoption of such paradigm is challenged by: (i) the openness and scalability needs of the operating environment, which rule out approaches based on centralized architectures and, (ii) the increasing concern for sustainability issues, which makes particularly relevant, in addition to QoS constraints, the goal of reducing the application energy footprint. In this context, we contribute by proposing a decentralized architecture to build a fully functional assembly of distributed services, able to optimize its energy consumption, paying also attention to issues concerning the delivered quality of service. We suggest suitable indexes to measure from different perspectives the energy efficiency of the resulting assembly, and present the results of extensive simulation experiments to assess the effectiveness of our approach.;;10.1007/978-3-030-58923-3_4;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58923-3_4;;;;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Workbench for Creating Block-Based Environments;Verano Merino, Mauricio and van Wijk, Koen;;2022;ACM Digital Library;61–73;;"Block-based environments are visual-programming environments that allow users to create programs by dragging and dropping blocks that resemble jigsaw puzzle pieces.  
These environments have proven to lower the entry barrier of programming for end-users. Besides using block-based environments for programming, they can also help edit popular semi-structured data languages such as JSON and YAML.  
However, creating new block-based environments is still challenging; developers can develop them in an ad-hoc way or using context-free grammars in a language workbench.  
Given the visual nature of block-based environments, both options are valid; however, developers have some limitations when describing them.  
In this paper, we present Blocklybench, which is a meta-block-based environment for describing block-based environments for both programming and semi-structured data languages.  
This tool allows developers to express the specific elements of block-based environments using the blocks notation.  
To evaluate Blocklybench, we present three case studies.  
Our results show that Blocklybench allows developers to describe block-based specific aspects of language constructs such as layout, color, block connections, and code generators.";;10.1145/3567512.3567518;https://doi.org/10.1145/3567512.3567518;;;Blockly, IDEs, Projectional editors, block-based environments, data languages, visual languages;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Application and Optimization of Artificial Intelligence Technology in Architectural Design;Ji, Long Hua and Che, Hangjun;Wirel. Commun. Mob. Comput.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;2022;In the era of rapid development, the demand for architectural design has surged. In this regard, artificial intelligence technology is integrated into architectural design. The application and optimization of artificial intelligence technology in architectural design is studied by comparative analysis method. The research is as follows: (1) there are many shortcomings in architectural design, and the cost control disconnection has the greatest impact through comparison. Simply adding on-site inspections to architectural design can better complete architectural design. (2) For the application of artificial intelligence in architectural design, through the F1 performance index, it is concluded that neural network technology is the most useful for architectural design, and its accuracy is also the highest. After the application of neural network technology, all indicators of architectural design are there is a big improvement.

Sci.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;3;The human brain responds better to visual information when compared to plain text. In other words, our brain consumes visual information more easily than text-only content, which helps improve communication, sharing and retaining information, reducing misinterpretation, and clarifying complex information. However, most of the tools adopted for software project management are based on textual reports. The number of software projects that fail is huge, and the stakeholders’ lack of understanding of the project is among the reasons for project failure. The implementation of data visualization using techniques and tools for project management can help identify and prevent project issues such as unexpected budget increases, unrealistic deadlines, lack of clear goals, and success criteria. In this paper, we extend our previous work by evaluating the proposed data visualization extension for the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® guide) in terms of its applicability in software project management and alignment within the PMBOK guide. The results from the evaluation show that our proposal adds support to visual project management and helps to identify the status and progress of the project quickly and prevent future issues related to communication.

;Delay-aware optimization of energy consumption for task offloading in fog environments using metaheuristic algorithms;Keshavarznejad, Maryam and Rezvani, Mohammad Hossein and Adabi, Sepideh;Cluster Computing;2021;ACM Digital Library;1825–1853;24;Due to the limitations associated with the processing capability of mobile devices in cloud environments, various tasks are offloaded to the cloud server. This has led to an increase in the efficiency of mobile applications in the two decades since the advent of the cloud paradigm. However, task offloading may not be a suitable option for delay-sensitive mobile applications because the cloud server is usually located remotely from mobile users. To overcome this problem, fog computing, also known as “Cloud at the Edge”, has been introduced as a complementary solution. On the other hand, although fog computing brings computing and radio resources closer to mobile devices, fog nodes cannot adequately meet users’ needs due to limited computing resources. To minimize delays in responding to mobile users’ requests, it is necessary to establish a trade-off between local execution of requests on end-devices and the fog environment. In this paper, we present task offloading in the form of a multi-objective optimization problem with a focus on reducing both total power consumption of the system and the delay in executing tasks. Then, considering the NP-hardness of the problem, we solve it using two meta-heuristic methods, namely the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the Bees algorithm. The simulation results supported the robustness of both meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of energy consumption and delay reduction. The proposed methods achieve a better tradeoff concerning both offloading probability and the power required for data transmission.;;10.1007/s10586-020-03230-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-020-03230-y;;;Fog computing, Task offloading, Energy consumption, Response time, Evolutionary computing;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1386-7857;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

A huge and ever-increasing amount of information is available to researchers to address these challenges. Unfortunately, it is stored in fragmented ontologies and databases, which use heterogeneous formats and poorly integrated schemas. To overcome these limitations, we propose a linked data approach, based on the formalism of multilayer networks, able to integrate and harmonize biomedical information from multiple sources into a single dense network covering different aspects on Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (NENs). The proposed integration schema consists of three interconnected layers representing, respectively, information on the disease, on the affected genes, on the related biological processes and molecular functions.

Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, and decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and each other in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated by different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human-agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism or games.;;;;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The Relevance of KES-Oriented Processes for the Implementation of ERP Systems: Findings From an Empirical Study in German SMEs;Rutz, Philipp and Kotthaus, Christoph and Pinatti de Carvalho, Aparecido Fabiano and Randall, Dave and Pipek, Volkmar;Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;7;Past and current research has shown that Knowledge and Expertise Sharing (KES) is central to the appropriation of enterprise software such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. ERP implementation projects in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are often driven by research and practice. However, they tend to focus on the 'go live' moment rather than on the subsequent, much longer post-implementation phase. This, we argue, results in decreased utilisation over time and an increased need for workarounds. In this paper, we draw on an empirical study within four organisations which exposes the limitations of KES in ERP implementation projects in SMEs, especially in regard to the preparation of key users. Our findings suggest that, despite key users' essential role in these projects, they are often chosen haphazardly and are ill-prepared. As a result, they cannot fulfil their role of facilitating KES with end users, who end up appropriating ERP systems mostly through 'learning by doing'. This stems directly from complex and largely unrecognised processes involving consultants, hotlines, management, key users and end users. In this paper, we introduce and discuss specific socio-technical, KES-oriented measures which can potentially lead to sustainable KES throughout the ERP life-cycle for longer-term success.;;10.1145/3610104;https://doi.org/10.1145/3610104;;;ERP system implementation, ERP systems, knowledge and expertise sharing;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Evaluating user interface generation approaches: model-based versus model-driven development;Ruiz, Jenny and Serral, Estefan\'{\i}a and Snoeck, Monique;Softw. Syst. Model.;2019;ACM Digital Library;2753–2776;18;Advances in software design possibilities have led to a growing interest in the study of user interfaces (UIs). Many Model-Based User Interface Development Environments (MB-UIDEs) have been proposed to deal with the generation of the UIs (semi-) automatically by using models with different levels of abstraction. Often, this generation is limited to the UI part of an application. However, achieving true model-driven development (MDD) requires the co-development of application and UI and, hence, needs to go a step further. This paper analyzes a large set of existing MB-UIDEs, evaluates, from a critical perspective, to what extent they can be considered full MDD environments, and adequately addresses the co-design of UI and application. Following the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (Engineering 2, 2007), we performed a systematic literature review. A total of 96 papers were examined. Based on these papers, an assessment framework containing 10 criteria with specific metrics to evaluate MB-UIDEs was defined and 30 different environments were evaluated following these criteria. The evaluation identifies several gaps in the existing state of the art and highlights the areas of promising improvement. The evaluation shows that, although a strong progress has being achieved over the last years, the existing environments do not yet fully exploit the benefits and potentialities of MDD, nor do they adequately integrate UI design with application logic design and generation. Further research needs to be done to support the MDD of UIs and the co-design of the underlying application. The difficulty of use of the existing MB-UIDEs, the lack of UI design flexibility, and the lack of complete and integrated development support are the main research gaps that need to be addressed.;;10.1007/s10270-018-0698-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-018-0698-x;;;Integration with application development, Model-based user interface software tools, Model-driven development, User interface generation;Springer-Verlag;1619-1366;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;What do we know about requirements management in software ecosystems?;Malcher, Paulo and Silva, Eduardo and Viana, Davi and Santos, Rodrigo;Requir. Eng.;2023;ACM Digital Library;567–593;28;Among the activities in requirements engineering (RE), requirements management ensures that requirements are tracked throughout their life cycle, changes are controlled, and inconsistencies are corrected. Requirements management has become increasingly critical in new ways of developing software and emerging contexts such as software ecosystems (SECO). The changing nature of the SECO introduces complexity in requirements management and results in varied flows of emergent requirements, making managing requirements in SECO challenging. Hence, understanding how requirements management is performed in SECO can help requirements managers improve their practices. This work aims to characterize requirements management in SECO. We have conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) to achieve this goal. We selected 29 studies using a hybrid search strategy (database search and snowballing). We defined nine characteristics of requirements management in SECO that differentiate it from requirements management in traditional software development. We identified four types of approaches to support requirements management in SECO: tool, method, model, and practice. We found that only three selected studies present an assessment of their approaches. Finally, we characterize requirements management in SECO as an open, informal, collaborative, and decentralized process involving multi-party actors susceptible to power relations.;;10.1007/s00766-023-00407-w;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-023-00407-w;;;Requirements engineering, Requirements management, Software ecosystem, Systematic mapping study;Springer-Verlag;0947-3602;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Here, explanations are essential to improve user confidence in recommender systems and to make the recommendation useful.
Providing explanation capabilities into recommender systems is not an easy task as their success depends on several aspects such as the explanation’s goal, the user’s expectation, the knowledge available, or the presentation method. Therefore, this work proposes a conceptual model to alleviate this problem by defining the requirements of explanations for recommender systems. Our goal is to provide a model that guides the development of effective explanations for recommender systems as they are correctly designed and suited to the user’s needs.

;Visualization in virtual reality: a systematic review;Korkut, Elif Hilal and Surer, Elif;Virtual Real.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1447–1480;27;"Rapidly growing virtual reality (VR) technologies and techniques have gained importance over the past few years, and academics and practitioners have been searching for efficient visualizations in VR. To date, the emphasis has been on the employment of game technologies. Despite the growing interest and potential, visualization studies have lacked a common baseline in the transition period of 2D visualizations to immersive ones. To this end, the presented study aims to provide a systematic literature review that explains the state-of-the-art research and future trends in visualization in virtual reality. The research framework is grounded in empirical and theoretical works of visualization. We characterize the reviewed literature based on three dimensions: (a) Connection with visualization background and theory, (b) Evaluation and design considerations for virtual reality visualization, and (c) Empirical studies. The results from this systematic review suggest that: (1) There are only a few studies that focus on creating standard guidelines for virtual reality, and each study individually provides a framework or employs previous studies on traditional 2D visualizations; (2) With the myriad of advantages provided for visualization and virtual reality, most of the studies prefer to use game engines; (3) Although game engines are extensively used, they are not convenient for critical scientific studies; and (4) 3D versions of traditional statistical visualization techniques, such as bar plots and scatter plots, are still commonly used in the data visualization context.

;Tracking and frame-rate enhancement for real-time 2D human pose estimation;Vidanpathirana, Madhawa and Sudasingha, Imesha and Vidanapathirana, Jayan and Kanchana, Pasindu and Perera, Indika;Vis. Comput.;2020;ACM Digital Library;1501–1519;36;We propose a near real-time solution for frame-rate enhancement that enables the use of existing sophisticated pose estimation solutions at elevated frame rates. Our approach couples a keypoint human pose estimator with optical flow using a multistage system of queues operating in a multi-threaded environment. As additional contributions, we propose a pose tracking solution and an approach to overcome errors caused by optical flow. A reduction in error in the range of 30–35% is observed at practical frame rates of pose estimator (4–6 frames per second) while processing 1920\texttimes{}1080 resolution 30 frames-per-second videos at native frame rate. Slower frame rates have increased the reduction of error up to 50%, thereby promoting the use of cheaper hardware and sharing of expensive hardware. Thus, while improving accuracy by enabling sophisticated pose estimation models to operate at above-par frame rates, our approach reduces cost per frame by promoting efficient resource utilization.;;10.1007/s00371-019-01757-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-019-01757-9;;;Human pose estimation, Real-time, Tracking, Optical flow, Frame-rate enhancement;Springer-Verlag;0178-2789;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Placement for Intercommunicating Virtual Machines in Autoscaling Cloud Infrastructure: Autoscaling and Intercommunication Aware Task Placement;Sridharan R. and Domnic S.;J. Organ. End User Comput.;2021;ACM Digital Library;17–35;33;Due to pay-as-you-go style adopted by cloud datacenters (DC), modern day applications having intercommunicating tasks depend on DC for their computing power. Due to unpredictability of rate at which data arrives for immediate processing, application performance depends on autoscaling service of DC. Normal VM placement schemes place these tasks arbitrarily onto different physical machines (PM) leading to unwanted network traffic resulting in poor application performance and increases the DC operating cost. This paper formulates autoscaling and intercommunication aware task placements (AIATP) as an optimization problem, with additional constraints and proposes solution, which uses the placement knowledge of prior tasks of individual applications. When compared with well-known algorithms, CloudsimPlus-based simulation demonstrates that AIATP reduces the resource fragmentation (30%) and increases the resource utilization (18%) leading to minimal number of active PMs. AIATP places 90% tasks of an application together and thus reduces the number of VM migration (39%) while balancing the PMs.;;10.4018/JOEUC.20210301.oa2;https://doi.org/10.4018/JOEUC.20210301.oa2;;;Autoscaling, Cloud Computing, Communication Latency, Elasticity, Intercommunication, Network Latency, Tasks Migration, VM Placement;IGI Global;1546-2234;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Netw.;2020;ACM Digital Library;902–916;28;"Growing mobile data usage has led to end users paying substantial data costs, while Internet service providers (ISPs) struggle to upgrade their networks to keep up with demand and maintain high quality-of-service (QoS). This problem is particularly severe for smaller ISPs with less capital. Instead of simply upgrading their network infrastructure, ISPs can pool their networks to provide a good QoS and attract more users. Such a &lt;italic&gt;vISP&lt;/italic&gt; (virtual ISP), for example, Google’s Project Fi, allows users to access any of its partner ISPs’ networks. We provide the first systematic analysis of a vISP’s economic impact, showing that the vISP provides a viable solution for smaller ISPs attempting to attract more users, but may not maintain a positive profit if users’ data demands evolve. To do so, we consider users’ decisions of whether to defect from their current ISP to the vISP, as well as existing ISPs’ decisions on whether to partner with the vISP. We derive the vISP’s dependence on user behavior and partner ISPs: users with very light or very heavy usage are the most likely to defect, while ISPs with heavy-usage customers can benefit from declining to partner with the vISP. Our analytical results are verified with extensive numerical simulations.";;10.1109/TNET.2020.2977198;https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2020.2977198;;;;IEEE Press;1063-6692;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;SUGAR: Speeding Up GPGPU Application Resilience Estimation with Input Sizing;Yang, Lishan and Nie, Bin and Jog, Adwait and Smirni, Evgenia;Proc. ACM Meas. Anal. Comput. Syst.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;5;As Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are becoming a de facto solution for accelerating a wide range of applications, their reliable operation is becoming increasingly important. One of the major challenges in the domain of GPU reliability is to accurately measure GPGPU application error resilience. This challenge stems from the fact that a typical GPGPU application spawns a huge number of threads and then utilizes a large amount of potentially unreliable compute and memory resources available on the GPUs. As the number of possible fault locations can be in the billions, evaluating every fault and examining its effect on theapplication error resilience is impractical. Application resilience is evaluated via extensive fault injection campaigns based on sampling of an extensive fault site space. Typically, the larger the input of the GPGPU application, the longer the experimental campaign. In this work, we devise a methodology, SUGAR (Speeding Up GPGPU Application Resilience Estimation with input sizing), that dramatically speeds up the evaluation of GPGPU application error resilience by judicious input sizing. We show how analyzing a small fraction of the input is sufficient to estimate the application resilience with high accuracy and dramatically reduce the duration of experimentation. Key of our estimation methodology is the discovery of repeating patterns as a function of the input size. Using the well-established fact that error resilience in GPGPU applications is mostly determined by the dynamic instruction count at the thread level, we identify the patterns that allow us to accurately predict application error resilience for arbitrarily large inputs. For the cases that we examine in this paper, this new resilience estimation mechanism provides significant speedups (up to 1336 times) and 97.0 on the average, while keeping estimation errors to less than 1%.;;10.1145/3447375;https://doi.org/10.1145/3447375;;;gpgpu application resilience, gpgpus, input-aware application resilience;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Container-based Virtualization for Real-time Industrial Systems—A Systematic Review;Queiroz, Rui and Cruz, Tiago and Mendes, J\'{e}r\^{o}me and Sousa, Pedro and Sim\~{o}es, Paulo;ACM Comput. Surv.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;56;Industrial Automation and Control systems have matured into a stable infrastructure model that has been kept fundamentally unchanged, using discrete embedded systems (such as Programmable Logic Controllers) to implement the first line of sensorization, actuation, and process control and stations and servers providing monitoring, supervision, logging/database and data-sharing capabilities, among others. More recently, with the emergence of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and the need for more flexibility, there has been a steady trend towards virtualizing some of the automation station/server components, first by using virtual machines and, more recently, by using container technology. This trend is pushing for better support for real-time requirements on enabling virtualization technologies such as virtual machines and containers. This article provides a systematic review on the use of container virtualization in real-time environments such as cyber-physical systems, assessing how existing and emerging technologies can fulfill the associated requirements. Starting by reviewing fundamental concepts related to container technology and real-time requirements, it goes on to present the methodology and results of a systematic study of 37 selected papers covering aspects related to the enforcement of real-time constrains within container hosts and the expected task latency on such environments, as well as an overview of container platforms and orchestration mechanisms for RT systems.;;10.1145/3617591;https://doi.org/10.1145/3617591;;;Real-time containers, industrial automation control systems, latency, virtualization of cyber-physical systems;Association for Computing Machinery;0360-0300;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;H-GOMS: a model for evaluating a virtual-hand interaction system in virtual environments;Zhou, Xiaozhou and Teng, Fei and Du, Xiaoxi and Li, Jiarui and Jin, Minxin and Xue, Chengqi;Virtual Real.;2022;ACM Digital Library;497–522;27;The virtual-hand interaction technique is a common input technique in virtual environments (VEs). The current application of virtual-hand interaction in VEs lacks specialized objective evaluation methods, making it difficult to establish a systematic functional goal orientation. To achieve a quantitative evaluation of the virtual-hand interaction system in VEs, we developed the modified evaluation method of goals, operators, methods, and selection rules (H-GOMS). The evaluation model contains five modules: analysis, decomposition, configuration, acquisition, and evaluation. To build the H-GOMS model, the relevant temporal parameters of operators in VEs were measured, and interactive rules were formulated for the configuration module. In addition to establishing the H-GOMS evaluation model, this paper demonstrates the development of a performance evaluation software (HI2ET) based on the Unity engine. We realized automatic retrieval and identification of the interactive behavior information from the software and applied the H-GOMS model algorithm for real-time visualization of the interactive process. The proposed method, with modeling of interactive tasks based on expert users, enables feasible and generally quantifiable performance evaluation for virtual-hand interaction systems in VEs.;;10.1007/s10055-022-00674-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-022-00674-y;;;Evaluation, GOMS model, Virtual-hand interaction, Virtual environments, Task performance;Springer-Verlag;1359-4338;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;The Impact of AR/VR on Spatial Memory Performance of Learners: A review;Atta, Mohammed Thamir and Romli, Awanis and Majid, Mazlina Abdul;;2021;IEEE Digital Library;75-79;;Today, the advancement in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) pave the way for establishing a simulated three-dimensional world for educational purpose and interactive learning. AR technology witness an increasing usage in recent years in the learning process of several areas of knowledge. However, using AR in education is still a big challenge and limited. There are certain constrains linked to the perception of learners to use AR as well as it is unclear to what extent this technology improves the spatial performance of learners in certain academics. Another question this study tries to answer, why AR is more effective than VR in preserving knowledge in learners’ minds. The purpose of this paper is to review the most important theories and reports on AR in education, and its connection to human spatial memory. The review of literature reveals that VR is an efficient technology and provide good tools for spatial memory research, but it still not compared with respect to spatial performance with AR. The significant impact of AR on learning ability of student is high by creating a sustainable and immersive education environment which enhance students’ spatial memory, especially in academic fields that are based on visual topics.;;10.1109/ICSECS52883.2021.00021;;;;"Industries;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Scientific computing;Education;Memory management;Immersive experience;Augmented Reality;Virtual Reality;Spatial Memory";;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Learning robots to grasp by demonstration;Elias {De Coninck} and Tim Verbelen and Pieter {Van Molle} and Pieter Simoens and Bart Dhoedt;Robotics and Autonomous Systems;2020;Science@Direct;103474;127;In recent years, we have witnessed the proliferation of so-called collaborative robots or cobots, that are designed to work safely along with human operators. These cobots typically use the “program from demonstration” paradigm to record and replay trajectories, rather than the traditional source-code based programming approach. While this requires less knowledge from the operator, the basic functionality of a cobot is limited to simply replay the sequence of actions as they were recorded. In this paper, we present a system that mitigates this restriction and learns to grasp an arbitrary object from visual input using demonstrated examples. While other learning-based approaches for robotic grasping require collecting a large amount of examples, either manually or automatically harvested in a real or simulated world, our approach learns to grasp from a single demonstration with the ability to improve on accuracy using additional input samples. We demonstrate grasping of various objects with the Franka Panda collaborative robot. We show that the system is able to grasp various objects from demonstration, regardless their position and rotation in less than 5 min of training time on a NVIDIA Titan X GPU, achieving over 90% average success rate.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2020.103474;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889019304956;;;Artificial neural networks, Machine learning, Collaborative robotics, Industrial internet of things;;0921-8890;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation for Monocular Visual SLAM Systems;Liu, Feng and Huang, Ming and Ge, Hongyu and Tao, Dan and Gao, Ruipeng;IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement;2024;IEEE Digital Library;1-13;73;Estimating monocular depth and ego-motion via unsupervised learning has emerged as a promising approach in autonomous driving, mobile robots, and augmented reality (AR)/VR applications. It avoids intensive efforts to collect a large amount of ground truth and further improves the scene construction density and long-term tracking accuracy in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. However, existing approaches are susceptible to illumination variations and blurry pictures due to fast movements in real-world driving scenarios. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework to fuse the complementary strength of visual and inertial measurements for monocular depth estimation. It learns both forward and backward inertial sequences at multiple subspaces to produce environment-independent and scale-consistent motion features and selectively weights inertial and visual modalities to adapt to various scenes and motion states. In addition, we explore a novel virtual stereo model to adopt such depth estimates in the monocular SLAM system, thus improving the system efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, EuRoC, and TUM datasets have shown our effectiveness in terms of monocular depth estimation, SLAM initialization efficiency, and pose estimation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art.;;10.1109/TIM.2023.3342210;;;;"Estimation;Visualization;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Cameras;Lighting;Feature extraction;Pose estimation;Feature extraction;monocular depth estimation;monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM);unsupervised learning;visual–inertial fusion";;1557-9662;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

We conducted an automated evaluation of user's memory recall performances (recall time, accuracy, and error) by mapping a sequence of user's behaviors and events as a string. Results revealed that ANN group showed significantly more accurate performance (1.3 times) in ME and time performance (1.64 times) in SE than TUT group, while no statistical main difference was found in CM.

;Live View Augmented Reality Technology Integrated IoT in Vocational Education Learning;Nidhom, Ahmad Mursyidun and Smaragdina, Azhar Ahmad and Gres Dyah, K N and Andika Bagus Nur, R P and Setiadi Cahyono, P and Suswanto, Hary and Hakiki, Muhamad Akhsan and Yunos, Jailani Md;;2021;IEEE Digital Library;210-215;;The major purpose of this research is to build a smart learning package for the vocational area that is interactive, powerful, versatile, and user pleasant by combining live view technology with Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things (IoT). The development process in this study is based on five stages of ADDIE development, one of which enables for mass production, which is the researchers’ goal for the next two years. The concept of Live view was first developed by Google in 2020 for the Google Street AI mechanism, however this technology has been designed to be compatible with AR since 2017. Since 2017, researchers have been working on AR, VR, and mixed reality technologies that can smoothly integrate. Although there is a lot of IoT and Live View technology, there is still a lot of work to be done in the field of learning so that the technology may be used widely. The result of the development of live view AR is a product that can display objects in real time or objects that can be directly viewed using an AR camera. This development product has gone through a series of tests in expert materials with an average of 87.45 percent, media experts with an average of 84.67 percent, and active users with an average of 89.99 percent. It can be determined that the product’s development is sound and that it can be used by the general public. Although there are 1 out of 5 scores in the “Effectiveness and seamless use of AR live view applications” category that are in the typical standard of assessment, this is conceivable owing to late synchronization. The IoT-based AR live view concept has been implemented well, with a TSe value of 612 with results of 85.3 percent, UI/UX Design with a TSe of 815 with results of 85.1 percent, and Visual communication with a TSe of 513 with results of 87 percent in the final stage of testing. This demonstrates that Live View Augmented Reality Technology Integrated IoT in Vocational Education Learning is accurate and ready to use.;;10.1109/ICEEIE52663.2021.9616802;;;;"Visual communication;Education;Media;Synchronization;Internet of Things;Augmented reality;Standards;Live View;IoT;Augmented Reality";;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Learnability factors of AR usage performance: Validating through survey;Hafsa, Sayera and Majid, Mazlina Abdul and Tawafak, Ragad M;;2021;IEEE Digital Library;371-376;;Augmented Reality has become an important learning medium in both educational and learning domain. AR has been in use within the game technology since long. Moreover, greater prospects of AR have been seen during learning and training, specifically in the developed countries. AR has contributed in enhancing the learnability of the users. In order to understand the impact of AR usage, this work starts by preparing the list of factors that influence the learnability with the AR usage. The list of seven (7) factors were identified through Literature Review (LR) using Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) 1984. Survey method was used to validate the factor’s questions, Next, the validated questions were given to student and academicians for answering through another survey for factor validation. Results showed the identified factors (Motivation, Better lab experience, Enhanced Focus, Satisfaction, Enable Visualization of Invisible Concepts, Better Learning and Performance and Confidence) within the Proposed Learnability Enhancement Model (LEM). Additionally, all the questions were validated with acceptance by experts and 32 academicians through the survey 1. Also, all the factors were accepted with 94% and above acceptance rate in survey 2. The significance of identifying these AR acceptance factors for enhancement of learnability will impact better learnability and performance with AR usage, the study will continue with testing the LEM efficiency through the simulation of AR usage on the real environment in the next phase of this work.;;10.1109/ICSECS52883.2021.00074;;;;"Training;Visualization;Scientific computing;Bibliographies;Computational modeling;Games;Boosting;Augmented Reality;Factor Validation;Education;Learnability Factors;Survey;Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory";;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Towards a symmetrical definition of QoE: An Evaluation of Emotion Semantics in Augmented Reality Training;Hynes, Eoghan and Flynn, Ronan and Lee, Brian and Murray, Niall;;2023;IEEE Digital Library;25-30;;"The current definition of quality of experience (QoE) designates delight and annoyance as diametrically opposing indicators of the degree of fulfilment of an application, service or system user's pragmatic and hedonic needs and expectations. However, these inherited emotion terms are rarely used to describe emotions of equal amounts of arousal or opposing amounts of valence in the literature. This work assesses the significance of this asymmetry to the definition of QoE by determining the utility of emotion terms to communicate the emotion component of QoE. This was done in the context of a QoE evaluation of augmented reality training instruction formats. Correlates were sought between various measures of emotional state. This included physiological ratings, facial expressions and eye gaze. Emotional state was subjectively reported using three distinct methods: self-assessment manikin questionnaire; 2D emotion space terms; and open-ended terms. Regression analysis showed multiple significant correlations between implicit and explicit metrics, but not to the emotion terms used by the participants. This calls into question the utility of such vaguely understood terms. The use of more symmetrically opposing emotions in the definition of QoE may benefit consensual interdisciplinary communication.";;10.1109/QoMEX58391.2023.10178564;;;;"Training;Correlation;Atmospheric measurements;Semantics;Particle measurements;Physiology;Regression analysis;quality of experience;emotion;augmented reality;procedure;training";;2472-7814;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This review synthesizes the AR technology, research design, data collection methods, settings, and intervention outcomes. Across the studies, the effect of using AR towards the learning of individuals was positive. However, given the wide variety of skills targeted in the shortlisted studies, and the heterogeneity of the participants, a summative conclusion regarding the effectiveness of AR for teaching social communication skills to an individual with ASD based on the existing literature is not possible.

However, only a few studies have comprehensively compared medical image registration approaches on a wide range of clinically relevant tasks. This limits the development of registration methods, the adoption of research advances into practice, and a fair benchmark across competing approaches. The Learn2Reg challenge addresses these limitations by providing a multi-task medical image registration data set for comprehensive characterisation of deformable registration algorithms. A continuous evaluation will be possible at https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org. Learn2Reg covers a wide range of anatomies (brain, abdomen, and thorax), modalities (ultrasound, CT, MR), availability of annotations, as well as intra- and inter-patient registration evaluation. We established an easily accessible framework for training and validation of 3D registration methods, which enabled the compilation of results of over 65 individual method submissions from more than 20 unique teams. We used a complementary set of metrics, including robustness, accuracy, plausibility, and runtime, enabling unique insight into the current state-of-the-art of medical image registration. This paper describes datasets, tasks, evaluation methods and results of the challenge, as well as results of further analysis of transferability to new datasets, the importance of label supervision, and resulting bias. While no single approach worked best across all tasks, many methodological aspects could be identified that push the performance of medical image registration to new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we demystified the common belief that conventional registration methods have to be much slower than deep-learning-based methods;;10.1109/TMI.2022.3213983;;;;"Task analysis;Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Image registration;Lung;Benchmark testing;Three-dimensional displays;Medical image registration;challenge;evaluation";;1558-254X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Mobile edge computing can assist in supporting AR applications running on mobile devices, which copes with compute-intensive and delay-sensitive requirements. However, subject to the limited and heterogeneous edge resources, offloading tasks to edge devices is not easy, especially if the application requires multi-party interaction. It is challenging to develop a credible task placement scheme that satisfies user experience with flexible use of edge resources. This article focus on the task offloading placement problem for AR overlay rendering in multi-party mobile augmented reality system. We first present our observations about performance bottlenecks of edge devices and explain the necessity of splitting the AR overlay rendering pipeline. We then formulate a joint optimization problem of task placement decisions, aiming to maximize the user experience of quality and minimize the service cost. We develop a novel decision approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address this complex problem. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method through extensive evaluation experiments.;;10.1109/TMC.2022.3232543;;;;"Task analysis;Rendering (computer graphics);Streaming media;Encoding;Servers;Augmented reality;Scalability;Augmented reality;deep reinforcement learning;mobile edge computing;task offloading";;1558-0660;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;DeepAdaIn-Net: Deep Adaptive Device-Edge Collaborative Inference for Augmented Reality;Wang, Li and Wu, Xin and Zhang, Yi and Zhang, Xinyun and Xu, Lianming and Wu, Zhihua and Fei, Aiguo;IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing;2023;IEEE Digital Library;1052-1063;17;The object inference for augmented reality (AR) requires a precise object localization within user's physical environment and the adaptability to dynamic communication conditions. Deep learning (DL) is advantageous in capturing highly-nonlinear features of diverse data sources drawn from complex objects. However, the existing DL techniques may have disfluency or instability issues when deployed on resource-constrained devices with poor communication conditions, resulting in bad user experiences. This article addresses these issues by proposing a deep adaptive inference network called DeepAdaIn-Net for the real-time device-edge collaborative object inference, aiming at reducing feature transmission volume while ensuring high feature-fitting accuracy during inference. Specifically, DeepAdaIn-Net encompasses a partition point selection (PPS) module, a high feature compression learning (HFCL) module, a bandwidth-aware feature configuration (BaFC) module, and a feature consistency compensation (FCC) module. The PPS module minimizes the total execution latency, including inference and transmission latency. The HFCL and BaFC modules can decouple the training and inference process by integrating a high-compression ratio feature encoder with the bandwidth-aware feature configuration, which ensures that the compressed data can adapt to the varying communication bandwidths. The FCC module fills the information gaps among the compressed features, guaranteeing high feature expression ability. We conduct extensive experiments to validate DeepAdaIn-Net using two object inference datasets: COCO2017 and emergency fire datasets, and the results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several conventional methods by deriving an optimal 123x feature compression for $640\times 640$ images, which results in a mere 63.3 ms total latency and an accuracy loss of less than 3% when operating at a bandwidth of 16 Mbps.;;10.1109/JSTSP.2023.3312914;;;;"Collaboration;Image coding;Bandwidth;Real-time systems;Adaptive systems;Task analysis;Deep learning;Augmented reality;device-edge collaborative inference;deep learning;feature compression;bandwidth adaptation";;1941-0484;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Augmented reality based criminal investigation system (ARCRIME);Haque, Shaheryar Ehsan I and Saleem, Shahzad;;2020;IEEE Digital Library;1-6;;Crime scene investigation and preservation are fundamentally the pillars of forensics. Numerous cases have been discussed in this paper where mishandling of evidence or improper investigation leads to lengthy trials and even worse incorrect verdicts. Whether the problem is lack of training of first responders or any other scenario, it is essential for police officers to properly preserve the evidence. Second problem is the criminal profiling where each district department has its own method of storing information about criminals. ARCRIME intends to digitally transform the way police combat crime. It will allow police officers to create a copy of the scene of crime so that it can be presented in courts or in forensics labs. It will be in the form of wearable glasses for officers on site whereas officers during training will be wearing a headset. The trainee officers will be provided with simulations of cases which have already been resolved. Officers on scene would be provided with intelligence about the crime and the suspect they are interviewing. They would be able to create a case file with audio recording and images which can be digitally sent to a prosecution lawyer.

;Predicting Human Performance in Vertical Hierarchical Menu Selection in Immersive AR Using Hand-gesture and Head-gaze;Pourmemar, Majid and Joshi, Yashas and Poullis, Charalambos;;2022;IEEE Digital Library;1-8;;There are currently limited guidelines on designing user interfaces (UI) for immersive augmented reality (AR) applications. Designers must reflect on their experience designing UI for desktop and mobile applications and conjecture how a UI will influence AR users’ performance. In this work, we introduce a predictive model for determining users’ performance for a target UI without the subsequent involvement of participants in user studies. The model is trained on participants’ responses to objective performance measures such as consumed endurance (CE) and pointing time (PT) using hierarchical drop-down menus. Large variability in the depth and context of the menus is ensured by randomly and dynamically creating the hierarchical drop-down menus and associated user tasks from words contained in the lexical database WordNet. Subjective performance bias is reduced by incorporating the users’ non-verbal standard performance WAIS-IV during the model training. The semantic information of the menu is encoded using the Universal Sentence Encoder. We present the results of a user study that demonstrates that the proposed predictive model achieves high accuracy in predicting the CE on hierarchical menus of users with various cognitive abilities.

Identifying emotions in spontaneous speech is a novel and challenging subject of research. Several convolutional neural network (CNN) models were used to learn deep segment-level auditory representations of augmented Mel spectrograms. The proposed study introduces a novel technique for recognizing semi-natural and spontaneous speech emotions based on 1D (Model A) and 2D (Model B) deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with two layers of long-short-term memory (LSTM). Both models used raw speech data and augmented (mid, left, right, and side) segment level Mel spectrograms to learn local and global features. The architecture of both models consists of five local feature learning blocks (LFLBs), two LSTM layers, and a fully connected layer (FCL). In addition to learning local correlations and extracting hierarchical correlations, LFLB comprises two convolutional layers and a max-pooling layer. The LSTM layer learns long-term correlations from local features. The experiments illustrated that the proposed systems perform better than conventional methods. Model A achieved an average identification accuracy of 94.78% for speaker-dependent (SD) with a raw SAVEE dataset. With the IEMOCAP database, Model A achieved an average accuracy of an SD experiment with raw audio of 73.15%. In addition, Model A obtained identification accuracies of 97.19%, 94.09%, and 53.98% on SAVEE, IEMOCAP, and BAUM-1s, the databases for speaker-dependent (SD) experiments with an augmented Mel spectrogram, respectively.

;Cascaded Segmented Matting Network for Human Matting;Liu, Bo and Jing, Haipeng and Qu, Guangzhi and Guesgen, Hans W.;IEEE Access;2021;IEEE Digital Library;157182-157191;9;Human matting, high quality extraction of humans from natural images, is crucial for a wide variety of applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, entertainment and so on. Since the matting problem is an ill-posed problem, most previous methods rely on extra user inputs such as trimap or scribbles as guidance to estimate alpha value for the pixels that are in the unknown region of the trimap. This phenomenon makes it difficult to be applied to large scale data. In order to solve these problems, we studied the unique role of semantics and details in image matting, and decomposed the matting task into two sub-tasks: trimap segmentation based on high-level semantic information and alpha regression based on low-level detailed information. Specifically, we proposed a novel Cascaded Segmented Matting Network (CSMNet), which uses a shared encoder and two separate decoders to learn these two tasks in a collaborative way to achieve the end-to-end human image matting. In addition, we established a large-scale dataset with 14,000 fine-labeled human matting images. A background dataset is also built to simulate real pictures. Comprehensive empirical studies on above datasets demonstrate that CSMNet could produce a stable and accurate alpha matte without the input of trimap and achieve an evaluation value that is comparable to the algorithm that requires trimap.;;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3125356;;;;"Image segmentation;Semantics;Task analysis;Saliency detection;Feature extraction;Decoding;Human matting;semantic segmentation;salient object detection";;2169-3536;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Pedestrian Heading Estimation Based on Spatial Transformer Networks and Hierarchical LSTM;Wang, Qu and Luo, Haiyong and Ye, Langlang and Men, Aidong and Zhao, Fang and Huang, Yan and Ou, Changhai;IEEE Access;2019;IEEE Digital Library;162309-162322;7;Accurate heading estimation is the foundation of numerous applications, including augmented reality, pedestrian dead reckoning, and human-computer interactions. While magnetometer is a key source of heading information, the poor accuracy of consumer-grade hardware coupled with the pervasive magnetic disturbances makes accurate heading estimation a challenging issue. Heading error is one of the main error sources of pedestrian dead reckoning. To reduce the heading error and enhance robustness, we proposed a novel heading estimation method based on Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), termed DeepHeading, which uses sensors embedded in a smartphone without any historical training data or dedicated infrastructure. We automatically annotate heading data based on map matching, and augment heading data based on device attitude. We leverage the STNs to align the device coordinate system and the navigation coordinate system, allow an unconstrained use of smartphones. Based on the characteristics of pedestrian heading continuity, we designed a hierarchical LSTM-basedSeq2Seq model to estimate the walking heading of the pedestrian. We conducted well-designed experiments to evaluate the performance of deepheading and compared it with the state-of-the-art heading estimation algorithms. The experimental results on real-world demonstrated that deepheading outperformed the compared heading estimation algorithms and achieved promising estimation accuracy with a median heading error of 4.52°, mean heading error of 6.07° and heading error of 9.18° at the confidence of 80% when a pedestrian is walking in indoor environments with magnetic field disturbances. The proposed method is high-efficiency and easy to integrate with various mobile applications.;;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950728;;;;"Estimation;Magnetometers;Magnetic sensors;Acceleration;Legged locomotion;Data models;Indoor positioning;heading estimation;pedestrian dead reckoning;deep learning";;2169-3536;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This can be beneficial to the consumers to minimize their valuable time wasted, and also, they will be able to get the real experience of shopping while getting exposure to marketing.;;10.1109/ICTer51097.2020.9325501;;;;"Information technology;Speech recognition;Speech processing;Companies;Virtual environments;Navigation;Logic gates;virtual reality;augmented reality;machine learning;image processing;voice recognition;hand gestures";;2472-7598;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A comprehensive framework for hand gesture recognition using hybrid-metaheuristic algorithms and deep learning models;Hassan Mohyuddin and Syed Kumayl Raza Moosavi and Muhammad Hamza Zafar and Filippo Sanfilippo;Array;2023;Science@Direct;100317;19;This paper presents a novel methodology that utilizes gesture recognition data, which are collected with a Leap Motion Controller (LMC), in tandem with the Spotted Hyena-based Chimp Optimization Algorithm (SSC) for feature selection and training of deep neural networks (DNNs). An expansive tabular database was created using the LMC for eight distinct gestures and the SSC algorithm was used for discerning and selecting salient features. This refined feature subset is then utilized in the subsequent training of a DNN model. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of the SSC algorithm in comparison with established optimization techniques, such as Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer(GWO), and Sine Cosine Algorithm(SCA), specifically in the context of feature selection. The empirical findings decisively establish the efficacy of the SSC algorithm, consistently achieving a high accuracy rate of 98% in the domain of gesture recognition tasks. The feature selection approach proposed emphasizes its intrinsic capacity to enhance not only the accuracy of gesture recognition systems and its wider suitability across diverse domains that require sophisticated feature extraction techniques.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.array.2023.100317;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590005623000425;;;Feature selection, Dimensional reduction, Big data, Meta heuristic algorithms, Machine learning;;2590-0056;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Hall;Current Opinion in Structural Biology;2022;Science@Direct;39-45;72;"The use of theory and simulation in undergraduate education in biochemistry, molecular biology, and structural biology is now common, but the skills students need and the curriculum instructors have to train their students are evolving. The global pandemic and the immediate switch to remote instruction forced instructors to reconsider how they can use computation to teach concepts previously approached with other instructional methods. In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. We are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2021.07.012;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X21001202;;;;;0959-440X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Low-Cost Federated Broad Learning for Privacy-Preserved Knowledge Sharing in the RIS-Aided Internet of Vehicles;Xiaoming Yuan and Jiahui Chen and Ning Zhang and Qiang (John) Ye and Changle Li and Chunsheng Zhu and Xuemin {Sherman Shen};Engineering;2023;Science@Direct;;;High-efficiency and low-cost knowledge sharing can improve the decision-making ability of autonomous vehicles by mining knowledge from the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). However, it is challenging to ensure high efficiency of local data learning models while preventing privacy leakage in a high mobility environment. In order to protect data privacy and improve data learning efficiency in knowledge sharing, we propose an asynchronous federated broad learning (FBL) framework that integrates broad learning (BL) into federated learning (FL). In FBL, we design a broad fully connected model (BFCM) as a local model for training client data. To enhance the wireless channel quality for knowledge sharing and reduce the communication and computation cost of participating clients, we construct a joint resource allocation and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) configuration optimization framework for FBL. The problem is decoupled into two convex subproblems. Aiming to improve the resource scheduling efficiency in FBL, a double Davidon–Fletcher–Powell (DDFP) algorithm is presented to solve the time slot allocation and RIS configuration problem. Based on the results of resource scheduling, we design a reward-allocation algorithm based on federated incentive learning (FIL) in FBL to compensate clients for their costs. The simulation results show that the proposed FBL framework achieves better performance than the comparison models in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and cost for knowledge sharing in the IoV.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2023.04.015;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809923002965;;;Knowledge sharing, Internet of Vehicles, Federated learning, Broad learning, Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, Resource allocation;;2095-8099;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Towards computational analytics of 3D neuron images using deep adversarial learning;Zhongyu Li and Xiayue Fan and Zengyi Shang and Lina Zhang and Haotian Zhen and Chaowei Fang;Neurocomputing;2021;Science@Direct;323-333;438;Benefited from advances of neuron tracing techniques, the ever-increasing number of digitally reconstructed 3D neuron images have greatly facilitated the research in neuromorphology. However, the sheer volume and the complexity of these 3D neuron data pose significant challenges for computational analytics, e.g., effectively finding neurons sharing similar morphologies, identifying neuron types, correlating neuron morphologies with properties, all of which require accurate measuring and fast indexing methods especially designed for the massive 3D neuronal images. In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient framework for the computational analytics of 3D neuronal structures based on advances of deep learning and data mining techniques. Particularly, unlike previous methods quantitatively describe neurons by measuring pre-defined metrics according to the tree-topological structures, we first develop a new method for the morphological feature representation by a proposed 3D neuron mapping and a modified generative adversarial networks (GANs). Subsequently, considering the computational complexity when retrieving large-scale neuron datasets, we integrate the neuron features with graph-based indexing, which can significantly improve the retrieval efficiency without losing accuracy. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively measure the similarity among massive neurons (e.g., 100,000 neurons), outperforming state-of-the-arts with more than 10% in accuracy and hundreds of times in efficiency improvements.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.03.129;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221001028;;;Computational neuroscience, 3D neuron image, Neuronal morphology, Generative adversarial networks, Large-scale retrieval;;0925-2312;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Safety education 4.0 – A critical review and a response to the process industry 4.0 need in chemical engineering curriculum;Yutian Qian and Sreeram Vaddiraju and Faisal Khan;Safety Science;2023;Science@Direct;106069;161;Safety education has found a place in the chemical engineering curriculum. However, its complete impact is yet to be realized. A part of this delay may be attributed to the gap between the concepts traditionally taught in engineering education and the tools required for the practice of engineering in the process industry. This gulf is only exacerbated by the advent of Industry 4.0, which relies heavily on emerging technologies, such as big data, automation, and machine learning. Therefore, a fundamental aspect that educators of process safety need to readdress is the following: “How can safety knowledge and competence among engineering graduates be enhanced for them to have a sustained impact on the safe design and operation of chemical processes during industrial practice?” In this context, the present work investigates the status of safety knowledge development and transfer from education to practice. A detailed analysis of demographic and temporal evaluation of safety education in specific engineering disciplines, and the shortcomings of the current curricula in imparting safety concepts to the students, are also discussed in detail. This perspective attempts to bridge the gap between academic training and the job requirements of process safety engineers through a concept titled ‘Safety Education 4.0’. In the proposed Safety Education 4.0 methodology, academics and industry personnel collaborate in teaching students safety principles through project-based learning (PBL). The compact modular format of PBL makes it flexible to be updatable on-demand process safety education.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2023.106069;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753523000115;;;Process safety education, Process system, Safety education, Process safety;;0925-7535;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;What is Virtual Reality? A healthcare-focused systematic review of definitions;Jonathan R Abbas and Alexander O'Connor and Eshwar Ganapathy and Rachel Isba and Antony Payton and Brendan McGrath and Neil Tolley and Iain A Bruce;Health Policy and Technology;2023;Science@Direct;100741;12;"Objectives
There has been significant advancement in virtual reality (VR) technology since its conception in 1960, and this evolution has particularly accelerated in recent years. Alongside this, we are seeing an expansion of research interest within which the definitions and nomenclature can be complex and lead to potential misunderstanding or confusion. We present a systematic review of definitions of the term VR as reported within the medical literature with the aim to establish the terminology used to define VR, the differences that exist through the literature, and if they have changed over time.
Methods
By reporting according to the PRISMA guidelines, we present a systematic review of VR definitions in the English language medical literature. The databases Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched using the search terms ‘virtual reality’, ‘definition’, ‘defined’, or ‘define’. Articles were included if they were peer-reviewed, within the medical literature, published between 22nd December 2001 and 22nd December 2021, and offered either an original or cited definition for the term VR. Following data extraction, quantitative analysis of terminology over time and term density maps have been created.
Results
Eighty-eight studies were included offering 105 definitions of the term VR. Of these articles, 58 were published within the last 5 years. Common terms when defining VR included ‘computer’, ‘environment’, ‘user’, ‘interactive’ and ‘simulation’. In recent years, a novel term ‘head mounted display’ has emerged which was not previously featured in healthcare literature.
Conclusions
This systematic review highlights that the published literature in the field of VR is rapidly expanding. With the growth in technology we can see a complex network of terminology emerge with little homogeneity. Definitions of VR are numerable and high variability exists. We recommend the requirement for consensus in order to urgently unify terminology within the immersive technology field, and whilst waiting for agreement, an evidence-based definition for VR has been suggested.
Public interest summary
A systematic review of the literature has been performed to better understand the terminology that academic authors have used to define what virtual reality technology is. This review concluded that a wide range of definitions have been used in the last 20 years. Throughout these definitions a large number of individual terms are being used with very little agreement on their appropriate use. With rapidly expanding technology and increasing complexity within the terminology, future research is at risk of misrepresentation until the academic community agree on the most appropriate terminology to be used when defining VR.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2023.100741;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211883723000199;;;VR, ‘Definition’, ‘Term mapping’, ‘Content analysis’;;2211-8837;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

First, the method needs to consider how to encourage devices to cooperate when they are selfish. Second, the method answers the following question: how can collaborative computing be carried out when the device has the intention to cooperate? For example, how can calculations be conducted when there are extensibility and privacy problems in machine learning tasks? In view of the above challenges, a mobile edge server is taken as the focus, and the available resources around the mobile edge server are used for collaborative computing to further improve the computing performance of a mobile edge computing (MEC) system. The alternating direction multiplier method is used to solve the problem. First, the relevant techniques and theories of MEC, Stackelberg principle-subordinate game theory, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are introduced. Then, the problem description and model construction of distributed task scheduling in MEC and machine learning task-based device coordination computing are introduced, and machine learning is applied in the distributed task scheduling algorithm and distributed device coordination algorithm.

Despite the wide interest, a systematic map of CT through programming in higher education is still missing. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we aim to provide a systematic map of the relevant research by identifying the areas and sub-areas of CT through programming teaching and learning in higher education. Second, we aim to investigate these areas based on two dimensions: their evolution over the years and the branches to which CT is applied. For this purpose, we apply a systematic mapping methodology. Main results include the identification of the CT areas of Knowledge Base, Assessment, Learning Strategies, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building. Of these, Knowledge Base, Assessment and Tools have significantly evolved throughout the years, while Capacity Building has only recently emerged. In addition, the introduction of CT to undergraduate students and preservice teachers differs mainly in the tools used and the CT elements that are assessed.

We wanted to find out the emerging technologies used in computing education, its evaluation and effectiveness, and limitations and gaps for future research. We carried out a Systematic Literature Review study on the use of Emerging Technologies in higher education computing education to identify the state of the art in the use of these three groups of technologies for assessment and feedback practices. After systematic search and filtering from a search pool of 3038 studies published between 2016 and 2021, we selected 38 articles for detailed meta-analysis. Our findings reveal that 71% of the reviewed studies are journal articles, 50% studies focus on learning analytics, and the majority of the studies employ quantitative approaches. The results from this systematic review suggest that XR technologies have received least attention to date in computing education (amongst the emerging technologies considered for the review) and there is a lack of frameworks for design, evaluation and use of emerging technologies in higher education. The findings of this review will be beneficial for researchers and educators to obtain an in-depth understanding of the main areas of application of emerging technologies in higher education computing education, an inventory of emerging technology tools used for assessment and feedback, effectiveness indicators, and evaluation approaches that have been used. For evidence-based guidance on future assessment and feedback practices using emerging technologies, we also present a brief research agenda, drawing attention to the need to trial more XR, focus on formative assessment and feedback practices, better understand impact of human-centric issues and take more thoughtful consideration of ethics in the use of emerging technologies in computing education.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2024.111988;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121224000311;;;Emerging technologies, Artificial intelligence, Learning analytics, Extended reality, Assessment, Feedback, Systematic literature review;;0164-1212;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Visual analogy videos for understanding fundamental parallel scheduling policies;Nasser Giacaman and Oliver Sinnen and Joel Adams;Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing;2021;Science@Direct;64-74;153;Parallel and distributed computing (PDC) education is increasingly gaining greater recognition as a core topic in undergraduate computing degrees. While the application of PDC concepts to software development involves the use of highly-technical tools and libraries typically reserved for advanced courses, PDC educators are seeking pedagogical approaches that can be used to introduce PDC concepts in earlier, introductory courses. This study presents such an approach, and aims to introduce undergraduate students to fundamental PDC concepts without the expectation that they can apply those concepts. The proposed approach is inspired by the success seen in the wider computing education literature, where analogies and visualization have helped students understand other abstract computing topics. The proposed learning resources come in the form of a series of short videos, carefully aligned to a learning activity that guides towards achieving the intended learning outcomes. In addition to being a simple activity to complete with students, evaluations illustrate its value even with minimal guidance from the instructor. The proposed approach is studied as both a synchronous in-class activity guided by the instructor, as well as an asynchronous online self-directed activity.

Dynamic transportation assignment has attracted more interest in the smart city construction under the new era of the Internet of things (IoT) because the urban road traffic is the heart of many problems in many fields, such as in the case of city congestion and processing center planning system. In this paper, we analyzed the processing center’s economic indexes and optimized the dynamic transportation network assignment based on continuous big IoT input database, and a high performance computing model is proposed for the dynamic traffic planning. Specifically, while the previous methods exploited the geographical information system (GIS) or K-means separately, the proposed transportation planning is based on the real-time IoT and GIS data, which is processed by DBN and K-means to make the final solution close to the practice and meet the requirements of high performance computing and economic cost. which is regarded as the key target index. Moreover, considering the large data characteristic of real-time online stream, the deep belief network (DBN) model is built to preprocess the data to improve the clustering effect of the K-means.

;Augmented Reality Visualization for Image-Guided Surgery: A Validation Study Using a Three-Dimensional Printed Phantom;H.H. Glas and J. Kraeima and P.M.A. {van Ooijen} and F.K.L. Spijkervet and L. Yu and M.J.H. Witjes;Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery;2021;Science@Direct;1943.e1-1943.e10;79;"Background
Oral and maxillofacial surgery currently relies on virtual surgery planning based on image data (CT, MRI). Three-dimensional (3D) visualizations are typically used to plan and predict the outcome of complex surgical procedures. To translate the virtual surgical plan to the operating room, it is either converted into physical 3D-printed guides or directly translated using real-time navigation systems.
Purpose
This study aims to improve the translation of the virtual surgery plan to a surgical procedure, such as oncologic or trauma surgery, in terms of accuracy and speed. Here we report an augmented reality visualization technique for image-guided surgery. It describes how surgeons can visualize and interact with the virtual surgery plan and navigation data while in the operating room. The user friendliness and usability is objectified by a formal user study that compared our augmented reality assisted technique to the gold standard setup of a perioperative navigation system (Brainlab). Moreover, accuracy of typical navigation tasks as reaching landmarks and following trajectories is compared.
Results
Overall completion time of navigation tasks was 1.71 times faster using augmented reality (P = .034). Accuracy improved significantly using augmented reality (P < .001), for reaching physical landmarks a less strong correlation was found (P = .087). Although the participants were relatively unfamiliar with VR/AR (rated 2.25/5) and gesture-based interaction (rated 2/5), they reported that navigation tasks become easier to perform using augmented reality (difficulty Brainlab rated 3.25/5, HoloLens 2.4/5).
Conclusion

;The HORSE framework: A reference architecture for cyber-physical systems in hybrid smart manufacturing;Konstantinos Traganos and Paul Grefen and Irene Vanderfeesten and Jonnro Erasmus and Georgios Boultadakis and Panagiotis Bouklis;Journal of Manufacturing Systems;2021;Science@Direct;461-494;61;In the Industry 4.0 era, manufacturers strive to remain competitive by using advanced technologies such as collaborative robots, automated guided vehicles, augmented reality support and smart devices. However, only if these technological advancements are integrated into their system context in a seamless way, they can deliver their full potential to a manufacturing organization. This integration requires a system architecture as a blueprint for positioning and interconnection of the technologies. For this purpose, the HORSE framework, resulting from the HORSE EU H2020 project, has been developed to act as a reference architecture of a cyber-physical system to integrate various Industry 4.0 technologies and support hybrid manufacturing processes, i.e., processes in which human and robotic workers collaborate. The architecture has been created using design science research, based on well-known software engineering frameworks, established manufacturing domain standards and practical industry requirements. The value of a reference architecture is mainly established by application in practice. For this purpose, this paper presents the application and evaluation of the HORSE framework in 10 manufacturing plants across Europe, each with its own characteristics. Through the physical deployment and demonstration, the framework proved its goal to be basis for the well-structured design of an operational smart manufacturing cyber-physical system that provides horizontal, cross-functional management of manufacturing processes and vertical control of heterogeneous technologies in work cells. We report on valuable insights on the difficulties to realize such systems in specific situations. The experiences form the basis for improved adoption, further improvement and extension of the framework. In sum, this paper shows how a reference architecture framework supports the structured application of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing environments that so far have relied on more traditional digital technology.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.09.003;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612521001898;;;Smart manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Cyber-physical systems, Reference architecture, HORSE EU project;;0278-6125;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Are you talking to me? An Audio Augmented Reality conversational guide for cultural heritage;Michalis Tsepapadakis and Damianos Gavalas;Pervasive and Mobile Computing;2023;Science@Direct;101797;92;Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are increasingly utilized as a means of stimulating immersive experiences to cultural site visitors, mainly through visual superimposition of interactive digital elements onto the physical world. Recent research has investigated the use of Audio AR (AAR) in heritage sites, wherein visitors listen to spatially registered sound which could be attributed to ‘talking’ physical artefacts. A parallel trend in the audience engagement programs of cultural institutions involves the employment of AI chatbots which are engaged in dialogues with followers or visitors to provide meaningful responses to a number of user questions. Herein, we present Exhibot, an intelligent audio guide system aiming at enhancing the user experience of cultural site visitors. Exhibot involves the combination of AAR and chatbot technologies to enable natural visitor-exhibit interaction, while also leveraging IoT devices to contextualize the delivered information. The key contribution of the proposed system lies in the interplay of AAR, chatbot and IoT technologies to create immersive learning experiences in the context of an integrated cultural guide system. Exhibot has undergone field trials to validate its usability and utility in realistic operational conditions. As a case study, we have chosen the statue of a prominent politician situated at a central square in Heraklion, Greece. The evaluation results indicated a very positive attitude of users, which is attributed both to the sense of immersion evoked by the AAR-powered storytelling and the natural human-like conversation enabled by the chatbot.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmcj.2023.101797;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157411922300055X;;;Audio Augmented Reality, Conversational audio guide, AI chatbot, Cultural heritage, Cultural user experience, IoT, Context-awareness, Spatial sound, User evaluation, IBM watson, Exhibot;;1574-1192;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The consolidation of game software engineering: A systematic literature review of software engineering for industry-scale computer games;Jorge Chueca and Javier Verón and Jaime Font and Francisca Pérez and Carlos Cetina;Information and Software Technology;2024;Science@Direct;107330;165;"Context:
Game Software Engineering (GSE) is a branch of Software Engineering (SE) that focuses on the development of video game applications. In past years, GSE has achieved enough volume, differences from traditional software engineering, and interest by the community to be considered an independent scientific domain, veering out from traditional SE.
Objective:
This study evaluates the current state of the art in software engineering for industry-scale computer games identifying gaps and consolidating the magnitude and growth of this field.
Method:
A Systematic Literature Review is performed following best practices to ensure the relevance of the studies included in the review. We analyzed 98 GSE studies to extract the current intensity, topics, methods, and quality of GSE.
Results:
The GSE research community has been growing over the years, producing over four times more research than before the previous GSE survey. However, this community is still very dispersed, with no main venues holding most of the GSE scientific studies. A broader range of topics is covered in this area, evolving towards those of a mature field such as architecture and design. Also, the reviewed studies employ more elaborated empirical research methods, even though the study reports need to be more rigorous in sections related to the critical examination of the work.
Conclusion:
The results of the SLR lead to the identification of 13 potential future research directions for this domain. GSE is an independent, mature, and growing field that presents new ways of software creation where the gap between industry and academia is narrowing. Video games present themselves as powerful tools to push the boundaries of software knowledge.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2023.107330;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584923001854;;;Computer games, Video games, Game software engineering, Systematic literature review, SLR, Industry-scale;;0950-5849;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Given the diverse application domains of Digital Twins, it is not surprising that the characterization of the term Digital Twin, as well as the needs for developing and operating Digital Twins are multi-faceted. Providing a better understanding what the commonalities and differences of Digital Twins in different contexts are, may allow to build reusable support for developing, running, and managing Digital Twins by providing dedicated concepts, techniques, and tool support. In this paper, we aim to uncover the nature of Digital Twins based on a systematic mapping study which is not limited to a particular application domain or technological space. We systematically retrieved a set of 1471 unique publications of which 356 were selected for further investigation. In particular, we analyzed the types of research and contributions made for Digital Twins, the expected properties Digital Twins have to fulfill, how Digital Twins are realized and operated, as well as how Digital Twins are finally evaluated. Based on this analysis, we also contribute a novel feature model for Digital Twins from a software engineering perspective as well as several observations to further guide future software engineering research in this area.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2022.111361;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121222000917;;;Software Engineering, Digital Twins, Manufacturing, Industry 4.0;;0164-1212;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;An examination of mobile phone pointing in surface mapped spatial augmented reality;Jeremy Hartmann and Daniel Vogel;International Journal of Human-Computer Studies;2021;Science@Direct;102662;153;We investigate mobile phone pointing in Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR), where digital content is mapped onto the surfaces of a real physical environment. Three pointing techniques are compared: raycast, viewport, and direct. A first experiment examines these techniques in a realistic five-projector SAR environment with representative targets distributed across different surfaces. Participants were permitted free movement, so variations in target occlusion and target view angle occurred naturally. A second experiment validates and further generalizes findings by strictly controlling target occlusion and view angle in a simulated SAR pointing task using an AR HMD. Overall, results show raycast is fastest for non-occluded targets, direct is most accurate, and fastest for occluded targets in close proximity, and viewport falls in between. Using the experiment data, we formulate and evaluate a new Fitts’ model combining two spatial configurations in a SAR pointing task to capture key characteristics, initial target occlusion, target view angle, and user movement. Analysis shows it is a better predictor than previous models.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2021.102662;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107158192100080X;;;Augmented reality, Mobile input, Pointing, Fitts’ modeling;;1071-5819;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This study collected literature on augmented reality (AR) from academic and patent databases to plot the historic development trajectory of AR and forecast its future research and development trends. A total of 3193 and 13,629 papers were collected from academic and patent databases, respectively. First, a network was established using references from the academic literature; main path analysis was conducted on this reference network to plot the overall development trajectory. Subsequent cluster and word cloud analyses revealed the following five major groups of AR research topics: AR surgical navigation applications, AR education applications, AR applications in manufacturing, AR applications in architecture, and AR applications in visual tracking. Subsequently, the relationships between the overall development trajectory and the five AR research topics were compared. Next, the title and abstract of AR-related academic and patent papers were subjected to text mining to identify keywords with a high frequency of occurrence. The results can provide a reference for industry, government, and academia when planning future development strategies for the AR field. This research adopted an integrated analysis procedure to plot the trajectory of AR technology development and applications successfully and effectively, predict future patent research and development directions and produce technological forecasts.";;https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc7010104;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2199853122008733;;;augmented reality, citation network analysis, main path analysis, open innovation, development trajectory, literature review;;2199-8531;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A meta-analysis approach to measure the impact of project-based learning outcome with program attainment on student learning using fuzzy inference systems;Mukta Goyal and Chetna Gupta and Varun Gupta;Heliyon;2022;Science@Direct;e10248;8;This paper presents a fuzzy inference method to investigate the impact of project-based assessment on the desirable outcomes by analyzing students creative and critical thinking, collaborative decision-making, and communication skills with realistic constraints and standards through theory and practical implementation in (a) course attainment and (b) on overall program attainment carried out in engineering discipline. This paper uses twelve specific parameters to capture program attainment parameters (PAPs). It proposes three main parameters to define various assessment system elements required for assessing course attainment parameters (CAPs), correlated with each other. To the best of the author's knowledge, to date, there is no defined mathematical tool to map CAPs to PAPs. Thus, this paper proposes assessment pedagogy to evaluate the PAPs corresponding to CAPs to handle the vague correlation mapping using fuzzy logic. The methodology and the preliminary results conducted for one year are promising, helping educators evaluate a candidate's performance individually or in a group on several assessment criteria, assisting in attaining the knowledge, values, attitude, deep learning, and skills needed for sustainable education development.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10248;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844022015365;;;Project-based learning, Bloom taxonomy, Course attainment parameters, Program attainment parameters, Fuzzy logic, Outcome based education, Assessment for learning;;2405-8440;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

A smartphone-based AR application was developed to support the workflow of producing special components based on AM. The developed app fosters the evaluation of individually engineered parts based on virtual three-dimensional (3D)-computer-aided design (CAD) models projected to the intended installation-site. This supports the detection of problems caused by inaccessible raw measurements or difficult to anticipate movements of the produced parts. The designed app was tested in a real-world industrial setting. In total, six production engineers conducted 12 test runs. The tests were video recorded and complemented by questionnaires. Both data sources served as a basis for the conducted analysis aiming to evaluate this case.

;Towards a proactive vision of the training for the 4.0 Industry: From the required skills diagnostic to the training of employees;François Marmier and Ioana Deniaud and Ivana Rasovska and Jean-Louis Michalak;IFAC-PapersOnLine;2021;Science@Direct;1144-1149;54;The digitalisation increase in industrial processes is perceived, by companies, as an opportunity to grow up their competitivity. Data are more and more accessible, potentially allowing making better decisions at all the level of the company. Then, job profiles and their required skills are changing. However, if competencies focused on software tools, programming, data analysis, simulation, virtual design, automatics and electronics becomes necessary, the initial trainings and continuous trainings are not changing as fast. Moreover, if new technologies are more available in companies, the workforce suffers of a lack of preparation. It generates risks of mistakes, improper use of tools and information, under performed activities, insufficiently informed decision. A global vision of how to train the whole industrial network is necessary to generate a progress of the whole industry. Workers must get the right skills for their activities in order to become a factor of efficiency for their workshop and consequently for the whole logistic chain. In that way, the role of the universities is to develop trainings for up-to-date needs as the industry 4.0. For this purpose, this paper introduced an overview of how to propose actual trainings on the topic of the Industry 4.0 both customized for the companies and for the learners. We detail more specifically in this paper 3 tools we develop at the University of Strasbourg: (1) a diagnostic tool to get the maturity level of companies and propose adapted learning paths.

;Augmented reality technology based on school physical education training;Yufei Liu and VE Sathishkumar and Adhiyaman Manickam;Computers and Electrical Engineering;2022;Science@Direct;107807;99;Physical education is a programme that combines skills and athletic experience. Applied coaching in augmented reality (AR) has rarely been utilized in school physical education. Visual coaching has also been used in athletic activities, but it neither includes immersive practice nor equally embodies academic learning and athletic skills. Recently, techno pedagogical methods have been introduced to utilize constructive teaching and learning progressions through information communication techniques (ICT). The main goal of this work is to analyze the effect of teaching by applying increased physical education realities for spatial orientation creation and acquisition in contrast to conventional exhibition education. To educate school students in physical education advancements, the AR method of training is efficient, particularly to obtain better performance in students' engagement in sports. However, the massively augmented reality renderings limit the operating environment to a costlier, high-complexity integrated unit, and it is impossible to run AR simulations on normal computers. Considering the above issues, this article designs and suggests an augmented reality (AR) solution for school physical education training based on augmented reality technologies: a cloud network, Internet of things (IoT), and remote users. AR simulation outcomes explored that sportsperson performance data and input from sports trainers, the positive impact of the augmented reality environment, is demonstrated to enhance the school physical education systems' training and learning ability.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2022.107807;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790622001070;;;School physical education, Augmented reality, Visual analysis, IoT, Multimodal analysis;;0045-7906;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;CREANDO: Tool for creating pervasive games to increase the learning motivation in higher education students;Jeferson Arango-López and Carlos C. {Cerón Valdivieso} and Cesar A. Collazos and Francisco Luis {Gutiérrez Vela} and Fernando Moreira;Telematics and Informatics;2019;Science@Direct;62-73;38;The pervasive games (PG) have had a great reception in recent years. This kind of games combines the virtual world with the real world to generate extensions of reality in terms of time, space and social interaction. These extensions have involved users in experiences as varied as those exposed by augmented reality and the location of the player or mixed reality scenarios. In the educational context, games have been integrated little by little into learning processes. Specifically, PG have shown to have a higher level of immersion in people's daily activities. Therefore, a greater impact is generated when integrating the technologies of the PG and the narrative of a story that is told through the gaming experience. In order to explore some fields, we focus the study on the narrative and geolocation applied to close spaces, it is a way of giving an enriched experience to the player through a digital transformation perspective. For this reason, it is necessary to have a platform that allows the creation and edition of PG based on narrative to increase the motivation of higher education students. This article describes the creation of a platform that integrates tools for creating stories and editing narrative content in the game experiences. The main objective is focused on increasing the motivation of students in educational processes. Specifically, the platform allows the creation of pervasive gaming experiences in closed spaces on university campuses. In addition, the results of a test case developed with the platform and its validation through statistical tools and gameplay metrics are exposed, thus demonstrating the increase in students' motivation through the use of PG.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2018.08.005;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585318306154;;;Pervasive game, Narrative, Learning motivation, Digital transformation;;0736-5853;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;An end-to-end framework for unconstrained monocular 3D hand pose estimation;Sanjeev Sharma and Shaoli Huang;Pattern Recognition;2021;Science@Direct;107892;115;This work addresses the challenging problem of unconstrained 3D hand pose estimation using monocular RGB images. Most of the existing approaches assume some prior knowledge of hand (such as hand locations and side information) is available for 3D hand pose estimation. This restricts their use in unconstrained environments. Therefore, we present an end-to-end framework that robustly predicts hand prior information and accurately infers 3D hand pose by learning ConvNet models while only using keypoint annotations. To enhance the hand detector’s robustness, we propose a novel keypoint-based method to simultaneously predict hand regions and side labels, unlike existing methods that suffer from background color confusion caused by using segmentation or detection-based technology. Moreover, inspired by the human hand’s biological structure, we introduce two geometric constraints directly into the 3D coordinates prediction that further improves its performance. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-art methods on standard benchmark datasets while providing robust predictions.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.107892;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321000790;;;Hand detection, Hand tracking, Hand pose estimation, Computer vision, Deep learning;;0031-3203;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

However, conventional balance training methods may have limitations in terms of motivation, real-time objective feedback, and personalization, which a virtual reality (VR) setup may provide a better alternative. In this work, we present an immersive VR training environment for lower extremity balance rehabilitation with real-time guidance and feedback. The VR training environment immerses the user in a 3D ice rink model where a virtual coach (agent) leads them through a series of balance poses, and the user controls a trainee avatar with their own movements. We developed two coaching styles: positive-reinforcement and autonomous-supportive, and two viewpoints of the trainee avatar: first-person and third-person. The proposed environment was evaluated in a user study with healthy, non-clinical participants (n=16, 24.4 ± 5.7 years old, 9 females). Our results show that participants showed stronger performance in the positive-reinforcement style compared to the autonomous-supportive style. Additionally, in the third-person viewpoint, the participants exhibited more stability in the positive-reinforcement style compared to the autonomous-supportive style. For viewpoint, participants exhibited stronger performance in the first-person viewpoint compared to third-person in the autonomous-supportive style, while they were comparable in the positive-reinforcement style. We observed no significant effects on the foot height and number of mistakes. Furthermore, we report the analysis of user performance with balance training poses and subjective measures based on questionnaires to assess the user experience, usability, and task load. The proposed VR balance training could offer an interactive, adaptive, and engaging environment and open new potential research directions for lower extremity rehabilitation.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2024.01.007;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849324000062;;;Virtual reality, Balance training, Lower extremity rehabilitation, Guided VR training, Human-computer interaction;;0097-8493;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Monitoring Applications for Vehicle based on Internet of Things (IoT) using the MQTT Protocol; Nurudin and Arief Agus Sukmandhani and Muhammad Zarlis;Procedia Computer Science;2023;Science@Direct;73-82;227;Monitoring of vehicle conditions is needed as one of the securities in driving because one of the accident rates is negligence in checking the condition of the vehicle. This study aims to help reduce the level of accidents and increase human awareness for vehicle conditions, especially minibus type vehicles. The system works to provide information on the condition of vehicles sourced from the Engine Control Unit (ECU). ECU data cars are obtained by SNIP traffic broadcast message and ask for data directly at the ECU. The car can provide vehicle information using a Canbus communication protocol through the OBD-II socket. Vehicle information can be seen by users through the website in real time. Based on the evaluation from the user side, this system provides ease of monitoring vehicle conditions because it can be accessed via the internet using various kinds of devices.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2023.10.504;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923016708;;;OBD-II, Blackbox, Sstem Logging, ECU;;1877-0509;;8th International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI 2023);"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A privacy calculus model for contact tracing apps: Analyzing the use behavior of the German Corona-Warn-App with a longitudinal user study;David Harborth and Sebastian Pape;Computers & Security;2023;Science@Direct;103338;132;The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a pressing societal issue today. The German government promotes a contract tracing app named Corona-Warn-App (CWA), aiming to change citizens’ health behaviors during the pandemic by raising awareness about potential infections and enable infection chain tracking. Technical implementations, citizens’ perceptions, and public debates around apps differ between countries, e. g., in Germany there has been a huge discussion on potential privacy issues of the app. Thus, we analyze effects of privacy concerns regarding the CWA, perceived CWA benefits, and trust in the German healthcare system to answer why citizens use the CWA. In our initial conference publication at ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection – 37th IFIP TC 11 International Conference, SEC 2022, we used a sample with 1752 actual users and non-users of the CWA and and support for the privacy calculus theory, i. e., individuals weigh privacy concerns and benefits in their use decision. Thus, citizens privacy perceptions about health technologies (e. g., shaped by public debates) are crucial as they can hinder adoption and negatively affect future fights against pandemics. In this special issue, we adapt our previous work by conducting a second survey 10 months after our initial study with the same pool of participants (830 participants from the first study participated in the second survey). The goal of this longitudinal study is to assess changes in the perceptions of users and non-users over time and to evaluate the influence of the significantly lower hospitalization and death rates on the use behavior which we could observe during the second survey. Our results show that the privacy calculus is relatively stable over time. The only relationship which significantly changes over time is the effect of privacy concerns on the use behavior which significantly decreases over time, i. e., privacy concerns have a lower negative effect one the CWA use indicating that it did not play such an important role in the use decision at a later point in time in the pandemic. We contribute to the literature by introducing one of the rare longitudinal analyses in the literature focusing on the privacy calculus and changes over time in the relevant constructs as well as the relationships between the calculus constructs and target variables (in our case use behavior of a contact tracing app). We can see that the explanatory power of the privacy calculus model is relatively stable over time even if strong externalities might affect individual perceptions related to the model.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103338;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823002481;;;Covid-19, Contact tracing apps, Information privacy, Longitudinal user study, Health-app adoption;;0167-4048;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Robust real-world point cloud registration by inlier detection;Xiaoshui Huang and Yangfu Wang and Sheng Li and Guofeng Mei and Zongyi Xu and Yucheng Wang and Jian Zhang and Mohammed Bennamoun;Computer Vision and Image Understanding;2022;Science@Direct;103556;224;Real-world point cloud registration is challenging because of large outliers in correspondence search. The mixture variations, such as partial overlap, noise and cross sources, are the root cause of these large outliers. Existing methods face challenges in effectively removing the large outliers. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework to remove the outliers by detecting the accurate inlier correspondences. Specifically, our coarse module predicts the top-K accurate correspondences. The coarse module is trained by jointly leveraging global and local structured information. Then, our refinement module checks the correspondences further using our proposed novel higher-order filter, which enables the structure conformity of correspondences to improve the quality of inlier correspondences. The final transformation matrix is calculated by using the refined inlier correspondences. Furthermore, a new cross-source point cloud dataset is proposed to further demonstrate the robustness in real-world point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on both indoor and outdoor, same-source and newly proposed cross-source real-world point clouds.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2022.103556;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314222001345;;;Point cloud registration, Matching, Localization, 3d reconstruction;;1077-3142;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Modelling and transposition of location-based games;Cristiane Ferreira and Luís Fernando Maia and Carlos {de Salles} and Fernando Trinta and Windson Viana;Entertainment Computing;2019;Science@Direct;100295;30;Design and development of Location-Based Games (LBG) are not trivial tasks due to their pervasive nature, multidisciplinary requirements, and global deployment issues. This paper presents a model-based approach to describe and generate LBGs. Our approach separates location data, game mechanics, and media content from the game implementation. We aim at allowing LBGs to be edited and deployed in many places quickly. The core is LeGaL, an extension of NCL (Nested Context Language) that models and represents the game structure and its multimedia contents (e.g., video, 3D objects). Its novel approach allows the modelling of mission-based games by supporting relationships between game elements and multimedia documents. We also present a transposition method that provides for LBGs to be deployed around distinct cities in the world by generating balanced game maps. To validate this approach, we applied map balancing measurements to compare the transposed map of an LBG. Additionally, we implemented an authoring tool and a game server that enabled us to model, generate, and to map LBGs. We assessed LeGaL using a qualitative evaluation with six NCL developers. Positive results indicate that our model-based approach has the potential to improve the design and development of LBGs.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2019.100295;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187595211830017X;;;Location-based games, Game modelling, Game map transposition, NCL;;1875-9521;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Academic researchers are incentivised to publish their research in high-ranking journals and academic conferences but also to demonstrate the impact of their outputs through metrics such as citation counts, altmetrics, policy and practice impacts, and demonstrable institutional decision-making influence. However, academic research has been criticized for: its theoretical emphasis, high degree of complexity, jargon-heavy language, disconnect from industry and societal needs, overly complex and lengthy publishing timeframe, and misalignment between academic and industry objectives. Initiatives such as collaborative research projects and technology transfer offices have attempted to deliver meaningful impact, but significant barriers remain in the identification and evaluation of tangible impact from academic research.

Often these non-programmers use visual languages to specify the robot’s and/or machine’s control logic. While visual languages are explored as a means to enable novices to program, there is little understanding of what problems novices face when tasked with realistic adaptation programming tasks on the shop floor. In this paper, we report the results of a controlled experiment where domain experts in the injection molding industry inspected and changed realistic programs involving a robot, injection molding machine, and additional external machines. We found that participants were comparably quick to understand the program behavior with a familiar sequential function chart-based language and a Blockly-based language used for the first time. We also observed that these non-programmers had difficulty in multiple aspects independent of language due to the interweaving of physical and software-centric interaction between robot and machine. We conclude that assistance needs to go beyond optimizing available language elements to include suggesting relevant programming elements and their sequence.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2022.111547;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121222002230;;;Robot programming, End-user programming, Manufacturing automation, Block-based programming languages, Sequential function charts;;0164-1212;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Now if they converge, we can solidly expect a paradigm shift and the impacts will be mesmerizingly profound and phenomenal. The fusion of these two popular technologies is laying down a spectacular foundation for creating new kinds of experiences and opportunities for people. Newer possibilities can easily come up across business verticals. There will be premium and people-centric services emerging and evolving for automating and accelerating a number of manual activities in our daily lives. This unique combination can result in fructifying the longstanding demand of people IT. These also smoothen the path and clear the route for the age-old transition from business IT to people IT. This convergence directly influences peoples' lives in a distinguishing and deft manner. This can save time, improve privacy, reduce network traffic, and enable applications or devices to be optimized for specific environments.

;Towards practical 3D ultrasound sensing on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices;Shuangjiao Zhai and Guixin Ye and Zhanyong Tang and Jie Ren and Dingyi Fang and Baoying Liu and Zheng Wang;Computer Networks;2021;Science@Direct;107990;191;Ultrasound based contactless sensing has the potential to extend the interactive range of mobile devices significantly. However, existing approaches either require multiple transceiver pairs that are not available on commercial mobile devices or can only recognize simple actions with one single stroke. These drawbacks significantly limit the practicability of prior work. This article presents UltraScr, an ultrasound sensing system that can recognize the sophisticated gestures with multiple strokes (e.g., writing a capital letter) using just a single sound transceiver pair. To do so, UltraScr first uses the frequency attenuation profile (FAP) to capture the subtle hand movements. It then employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the subtle hand movements’ discriminative features to build an accurate ultrasound sensing system. We go further by exploiting the rejection classification method (RCM) and incremental learning to improve the robustness of our sensing system in the end-user environment. We evaluate UltraScr by applying it to gesture recognition across different scenarios and users. Extensive experimental results show that while using only one transceiver pair, the performance of UltraScr is comparable to the multi-transceiver-paired implementations. We show that UltraScr is robust to the change of external conditions (i.e., different humidity and battery) and can work effectively on a wide range of locations, but requires 3× fewer training samples compared to the state-of-the-art.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.107990;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128621001134;;;Wireless sensing, Frequency attenuation profile, Ultrasound sensing, Machine learning;;1389-1286;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Recent advances in vision-based indoor navigation: A systematic literature review;Dawar Khan and Zhanglin Cheng and Hideaki Uchiyama and Sikandar Ali and Muhammad Asshad and Kiyoshi Kiyokawa;Computers & Graphics;2022;Science@Direct;24-45;104;Indoor navigation has remained an active research area for the last decade. Unlike outdoor environments, indoor environments have additional challenges, such as weak signals, low light, and complex scenarios. Different technologies are used for indoor navigation, including WiFi, Bluetooth, inertial sensors, and computer cameras. Vision-based methods have great potentials for indoor navigation as they fulfill most of the general requirements such as minimal cost, ease of use, ease of implementation, and realism. Therefore, researchers have successively proposed different novel vision-based approaches for indoor navigation. Unfortunately, there is no standard review article (except a few general reviews) that covers the current trends and draws a pipeline for future research. In this paper, we reviewed the current state-of-the-art vision-based indoor navigation methods. We followed the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology for article searching, selection, and quality assessments. In total, we selected 68 articles after final selection using SLR. We classified these articles into different categories. Each article is briefly studied for information extraction, including key idea, category of the article, evaluation criterion, and its strengths and weaknesses. We also highlighted several interesting future directions. This study will help new researchers to grasp the research challenge as well as present the results of their research in the field.

;YOLOPose V2: Understanding and improving transformer-based 6D pose estimation;Arul Selvam Periyasamy and Arash Amini and Vladimir Tsaturyan and Sven Behnke;Robotics and Autonomous Systems;2023;Science@Direct;104490;168;6D object pose estimation is a crucial prerequisite for autonomous robot manipulation applications. The state-of-the-art models for pose estimation are convolutional neural network (CNN)-based. Lately, Transformers, an architecture originally proposed for natural language processing, is achieving state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks as well. Equipped with the multi-head self-attention mechanism, Transformers enable simple single-stage end-to-end architectures for learning object detection and 6D object pose estimation jointly. In this work, we propose YOLOPose (short form for You Only Look Once Pose estimation), a Transformer-based multi-object 6D pose estimation method based on keypoint regression and an improved variant of the YOLOPose model. In contrast to the standard heatmaps for predicting keypoints in an image, we directly regress the keypoints. Additionally, we employ a learnable orientation estimation module to predict the orientation from the keypoints. Along with a separate translation estimation module, our model is end-to-end differentiable. Our method is suitable for real-time applications and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We analyze the role of object queries in our architecture and reveal that the object queries specialize in detecting objects in specific image regions. Furthermore, we quantify the accuracy trade-off of using datasets of smaller sizes to train our model.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2023.104490;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092188902300129X;;;Vision transformers, Object pose estimation, Object detection;;0921-8890;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Healthcare analytics: A techno-functional perspective;Sumanta Singha and Himanshu Arha and Arpan Kumar Kar;Technological Forecasting and Social Change;2023;Science@Direct;122908;197;The use of data analytics, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), has significantly transformed decision-making in healthcare. However, academic scholarship has expressed concerns over the misalignment of research priorities and their impact on data usage and choice of analytics. On the one hand, an inadequate understanding of healthcare themes and algorithmic nuances has posed difficulty for healthcare professionals to evaluate AI solutions and understand their generalizability and potential biases. On the other hand, the abundance of analytical tools, their complexity, and a misalignment between data type and analysis methods have presented major challenges for analysts in selecting a suitable method. As a result, healthcare research has mostly developed in silos. We propose a techno-functional framework that combines the perspectives of analysts and healthcare professionals, identifies key research themes (i.e., healthcare delivery, patient engagement, data management, market design, and policy and governance), and presents critical research questions that can guide future studies. We also propose a schema for segmenting analysis techniques based on data type and analytical complexity. This schema may help analysts select a suitable analysis technique and data to solve a specific problem.

;Dependent tasks offloading in mobile edge computing: A multi-objective evolutionary optimization strategy;Yanqi Gong and Kun Bian and Fei Hao and Yifei Sun and Yulei Wu;Future Generation Computer Systems;2023;Science@Direct;314-325;148;Due to the proliferation of applications such as virtual reality and online games with high real-time requirements, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has become a promising computing paradigm that can improve user experience and reduce the task offloading latency. The cloud–edge-end collaborative offloading further addresses the problem of insufficient computing resources of edge servers owing to large-scale computing-intensive applications in MEC. However, existing offloading solutions often ignore the important factor of economic cost, making it hard for these solutions to achieve a sustainable cloud–edge-end collaborative computation. To this end, this paper considers a multi-user multi-server, cloud–edge-end collaborative offloading scenario in the presence of dependent offloading tasks for the sake of maximizing rewards and minimizing latency. Each user issues a computing-intensive application consisting of multiple dependent tasks, which are offloaded collaboratively by various computational resources. With the goal of maximizing the yield of offloading for users and server providers, a multi-objective optimization problem of joint task offloading and execution rewards is studied. Technically, a multivariate multi-objective optimization problem with three objectives is modeled. An efficient multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm based on MOEA/D is then developed to solve the latency minimization and reward maximization problems. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and illustrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve user offloading benefits. In addition, a scalability evaluations of our proposed algorithm is conducted for demonstrating its feasibility in large-scale task offloading scenarios.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2023.06.015;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X23002364;;;Dependent task offloading, Mobile edge computing, Multi-objective optimization, Evolutionary computation, Cloud–edge-end collaborative computing;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Instead, a new computing paradigm, called Fog Computing, is envisioned as an architectural means to realize the IT/OT convergence. In this paper we propose a Fog Computing Platform (FCP) reference architecture targeting Industrial IoT applications. The FCP is based on: deterministic virtualization that reduces the effort required for safety and security assurance; middleware for supporting both critical control and dynamic Fog applications; deterministic networking and interoperability, using open standards such as IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA); mechanisms for resource management and orchestration; and services for security, fault tolerance and distributed machine learning.

;What about the usability in low-code platforms? A systematic literature review;Daniel Pinho and Ademar Aguiar and Vasco Amaral;Journal of Computer Languages;2023;Science@Direct;101185;74;"Context:
Low-code development is a concept whose presence has grown both in academia and the software industry and is discussed alongside others, such as model-driven engineering and domain-specific languages. Usability is an important concept in low-code contexts since users of these tools often lack a background in programming. Grey literature articles have also stated that low-code tools have high usability.
Objective:
This paper examines the current literature about low-code and no-code to discover more about them and their relationship with usability, particularly its quality, which factors are the most relevant, and how users view these tools. This focus on usability aims to provide a different point of view from other works on low-code.
Method:
We performed a systematic literature review based on a formal protocol for this study. The search protocol returned a total of 207 peer-review articles across five databases, which was supplemented with a snowballing process. These were filtered using inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 38 relevant articles that were analysed, synthesised and reported.
Conclusion:
Despite growing interest and a strong enterprise presence in academia, we did not find a formal definition of low-code, although common characteristics have been specified. We found that users have a heightened awareness of usability regarding low-code tools, with some authors performing feasibility studies on their implementations or listing factors that influence the user experience in a given tool. Researchers are considering usability factors unconsciously, and the low-code field would grow if research on usability increased. This paper also suggests a definition for low-code development.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cola.2022.101185;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259011842200082X;;;Low-code development, Usability, Model-driven engineering, User experience;;2590-1184;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The combination of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, allows improvements and optimisation in many logistics processes, but claims for advanced stable real-time communication. The fifth generation of Mobile Communication Networks, the so-called 5G, has the potential to meet these requirements and substantially support the development of Smart Logistics. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to identify the main logistics areas and activities in which 5G can be implemented, pointing out the expected benefits and the related technologies that can boost its large-scale adoption. The literature review also allows identifying the main challenges that currently prevent the 5G adoption in logistics processes, suggesting future research directions.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.261;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050922023390;;;5G, Logistics 4.0, 5G networks, Wireless communication network, Smart logistics;;1877-0509;;4th International Conference on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

In this paper, we review the burgeoning literature on FinTech and FinTech-enabled services, focusing on the opportunities and risks for banks. Using high quality bank level data from 115 countries around the world for the past 16 years, we compute statistical moments of some key indicators of the changing banking landscape in the FinTech era. Our preliminary findings suggest that it is unlikely that FinTech lenders will replace banks, perhaps because banks are developing their own FinTech platforms or working with FinTech start-ups.

;Binary thresholding defense against adversarial attacks;Yutong Wang and Wenwen Zhang and Tianyu Shen and Hui Yu and Fei-Yue Wang;Neurocomputing;2021;Science@Direct;61-71;445;Convolutional neural networks are always vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In recent research, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) has been recognized as the most effective attack method, and adversarial training on adversarial examples generated by PGD attack is the most reliable defense method. However, adversarial training requires a large amount of computation time. In this paper, we propose a fast, simple and strong defense method that achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off. We first compare the feature maps of naturally trained model with adversarially trained model in same architecture, then we find the key of adversarially trained model lies on the binary thresholding the convolutional layers perform. Inspired by this, we perform binary thresholding to preprocess the input image and defend against PGD attack. On MNIST, our defense achieves 99.0% accuracy on clean images and 91.2% on white-box adversarial images. This performance is slightly better than adversarial training, and our method largely saves the computation time for retraining. On Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, we train a new model on binarized images and use this model to defend against attack. Though its performance is not as good as adversarial training, it gains the best speed-accuracy trade-off.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.03.036;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221004045;;;Binary thresholding, Defense, Adversarial training, Adversarial attack;;0925-2312;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;RDRF-Net: A pyramid architecture network with residual-based dynamic receptive fields for unsupervised depth estimation;Zhen-yan Ji and Xiao-jun Song and Hou-bin Song and Hong Yang and Xiao-xuan Guo;Neurocomputing;2021;Science@Direct;1-12;457;Image depth estimation is a challenging problem in computer vision, especially considering both high accuracy and low run time. To save run time and maintain high accuracy, we present a new light-weight model in this paper, i.e., a Residual-based Dynamic Receptive Field Network (RDRF-Net). This model can automatically select the receptive fields suitable for different image scales to generate the depth maps with higher fitting degrees. Residual design and bottleneck layers are used to compress the network for reducing run time. Three groups of experiments are performed on the KITTI dataset to test the accuracy, computation time, and the impact of dynamic receptive fields. Experimental results show that RDRF-Net has comparable accuracy with Godard’s model and significantly outperforms it in terms of run time. In addition, it performs closely to Pyd-Net in terms of run time and beats Pyd-Net’s accuracy. Experiments also demonstrate the beneficial impact of dynamic receptive fields on improving depth estimation accuracy.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.05.089;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221008523;;;Convolutional neural network, Dynamic receptive field, Monocular depth estimation, Multi-scale pyramid architecture, Residual architecture;;0925-2312;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Immersive IDE: Towards Leveraging Virtual Reality for creating an Immersive Software Development Environment;Mehra, Rohit and Sharma, Vibhu Saujanya and Kaulgud, Vikrant and Podder, Sanjay and Burden, Adam P.;;2020;ACM Digital Library;177–180;;Positive affects have been shown to be positively correlated with developer productivity. Moreover, the environment in which the developer sits is important as it has a direct bearing on her emotions. However, in typical software development project setups, it is difficult to mold the surroundings of a developer according to her own needs or wishes. Moreover, large project areas may tend to have multiple distractions that may further negatively affect the developer. Multiple studies have shown that Virtual Reality can be an effective medium to induce positive emotions, with the capability to immerse oneself into virtually created environs, allowing for countless opportunities to surround a developer with what she would want. In this paper, we present our approach to allow a developer to choose her own surrounding environment to work in (say a beach, a park or in space!), while allowing for a real-time feed of her workstation/tools to be embedded in the same for a seamless experience. We believe that this approach will enable better mood/engagement and lower distractions/stress, which may lead to higher productivity and a balanced sense of developer well-being.;;10.1145/3387940.3392234;https://doi.org/10.1145/3387940.3392234;;;Virtual Workplace, Virtual Reality, Affective Computing;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

In this paper, we present a set of formal methods courses included in a Software Engineering &amp; Security track of ENSIIE, \'{E}cole Nationale Sup\'{e}rieure d’Informatique pour l’Industrie et l’Entreprise, a French engineering school delivering the [inline-graphic not available: see fulltext]Ing\'{e}nieur de l’ENSIIE[inline-graphic not available: see fulltext] degree (master level). These techniques have been taught over the last fifteen years in our education programs in different formats. One of the difficulty we encounter is that students consider these kinds of techniques difficult and requiring much work and thus are inclined to choose other courses when they can. Furthermore, students are strongly focused on the direct applicability of the knowledge they are taught, and they are not all going to pursue a professional career in the development of critical systems. Our experience shows that students can gain confidence in formal methods when they understand that, through a rigorous mathematical approach to system specification, they acquire knowledge, skills and abilities that will be useful in their professional future as Computer Scientists/Engineers.";;10.1007/978-3-030-32441-4_5;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32441-4_5;;;;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Compared with traditional handcrafted feature-based methods, the deep learning-based object detection methods can learn both low-level and high-level image features. The image features learned through deep learning techniques are more representative than the handcrafted features. Therefore, this review paper focuses on the object detection algorithms based on deep convolutional neural networks, while the traditional object detection algorithms will be simply introduced as well. Through the review and analysis of deep learning-based object detection techniques in recent years, this work includes the following parts: backbone networks, loss functions and training strategies, classical object detection architectures, complex problems, datasets and evaluation metrics, applications and future development directions.

;Semantically-enhanced topic recommendation systems for software projects;Izadi, Maliheh and Nejati, Mahtab and Heydarnoori, Abbas;Empirical Softw. Engg.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;28;"Software-related platforms such as GitHub and Stack Overflow, have enabled their users to collaboratively label software entities with a form of metadata called topics. Tagging software repositories with relevant topics can be exploited for facilitating various downstream tasks. For instance, a correct and complete set of topics assigned to a repository can increase its visibility. Consequently, this improves the outcome of tasks such as browsing, searching, navigation, and organization of repositories. Unfortunately, assigned topics are usually highly noisy, and some repositories do not have well-assigned topics. Thus, there have been efforts on recommending topics for software projects, however, the semantic relationships among these topics have not been exploited so far. In this work, we propose two recommender models for tagging software projects that incorporate the semantic relationship among topics. Our approach has two main phases; (1) we first take a collaborative approach to curate a dataset of quality topics specifically for the domain of software engineering and development. We also enrich this data with the semantic relationships among these topics and encapsulate them in a knowledge graph we call SED-KGraph. Then, (2) we build two recommender systems; The first one operates only based on the list of original topics assigned to a repository and the relationships specified in our knowledge graph. The second predictive model, however, assumes there are no topics available for a repository, hence it proceeds to predict the relevant topics based on both textual information of a software project (such as its README file), and SED-KGraph. We built SED-KGraph in a crowd-sourced project with 170 contributors from both academia and industry. Through their contributions, we constructed SED-KGraph with 2,234 carefully evaluated relationships among 863 community-curated topics. Regarding the recommenders’ performance, the experiment results indicate that our solutions outperform baselines that neglect the semantic relationships among topics by at least 25% and 23% in terms of Average Success Rate and Mean Average Precision metrics, respectively. We share SED-KGraph, as a rich form of knowledge for the community to re-use and build upon.

Although users can change their position and orientation, such as via teleporting, to help observe and select, doing so frequently may cause loss of spatial orientation or motion sickness. We present vMirror, an interactive widget leveraging reflection of mirrors to observe and select distant or occluded objects. We first designed interaction techniques for placing mirrors and interacting with objects through mirrors. We then conducted a formative study to explore a semi-automated mirror placement method with manual adjustments. Next, we conducted a target-selection experiment to measure the effect of the mirror’s orientation on users’ performance. Results showed that vMirror can be as efficient as direct target selection for most mirror orientations. We further compared vMirror with teleport technique in a virtual treasure hunt game and measured participants’ task performance and subjective experiences. Finally, we discuss vMirorr user experience and present future directions.;;10.1145/3411764.3445537;https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445537;;;vMirror, target selection, raycasting, out of reach, occlusion, Virtual mirror, Virtual Reality, VR, DOF;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A Multi-view Matching Method Based on PatchmatchNet with Sparse Point Information;Yang, Yang and Xu, Huarong and Weng, Lifen;;2022;ACM Digital Library;9–14;;The learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) method has become a research hotspot in 3D reconstruction. Deep learning can extract more robust semantic features of images and better adapt to scenes of soft texture and non-diffuse reflection. However, current deep learning methods focus more on improving the quality of reconstruction, and we believe that reducing depth estimation time and GPU memory consumption is equally important. Therefore, this paper proposes S-PatchmatchNet with higher accuracy and faster efficiency. Firstly, in the initial stage of depth estimation, we use Colmap to obtain sparse points and generate initial depth information through triangulation and interpolation to replace the random initialization of PatchmatchNet, which reduces the time consumed in random depth and improves computational efficiency. Secondly, we design an effective data enhancement mechanism. Specifically, a mask 1/3 of the size of the image is used to randomly erase data on the image. By minimizing the error between the prediction result of enhanced data and the ground reality, the sample prediction is standardized, the robustness of the model is enhanced, and the accuracy of depth prediction is improved. To test the validity of our method, we conducted tests on the DTU dataset. Compared to PatchmatchNet, the efficiency and accuracy of our approach are improved to varying degrees. Meanwhile, we get competitive results on challenging Tanks and Temples datasets.;;10.1145/3568364.3568366;https://doi.org/10.1145/3568364.3568366;;;Random erasing, Initial depth, Depth estimation, Data augmentation, 3D reconstruction;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Design Science Research in Information Systems as Educational Technology in Teaching and Learning Environments: A Systematic Literature Review;Eybers, Sunet;;2023;ACM Digital Library;385–402;;"Design Science Research in Information Systems (IS) is a research paradigm that aids in the understanding of a problem and subsequent solution development through a process of artefact development. This approach therefore seems applicable to the field of educational technology, where the main objective is the optimal delivery and improvement of learning and ultimately the ability to practically apply what has been learnt, including the use of technology.Furthermore, the continuous need to prepare learners for the future and subsequent Society 5.0 environment - which requires active participation and knowledge of innovative technologies post-graduation - requires educational institutions to take cognizance of teaching approaches which can aid in the optimization of the learning process, for example the utilization of artefacts in the transfer of knowledge to learners.The objective of this research is to perform a high-level scan of relevant published articles in support of our quest to investigate how Design Science Research in IS as an educational technology is currently used in teaching and learning environments. This is important to academics as it highlights the possibility of new teaching approaches and identifies possible gaps in current literature.

;Maximum entropy scaled super pixels segmentation for multi-object detection and scene recognition via deep belief network;Rafique, Adnan Ahmed and Gochoo, Munkhjargal and Jalal, Ahmad and Kim, Kibum;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2022;ACM Digital Library;13401–13430;82;Recent advances in visionary technologies impacted multi-object recognition and scene understanding. Such scene-understanding tasks are a demanding part of several technologies such as augmented reality based scene integration, robotic navigation, autonomous driving and tourist guide applications. Incorporating visual information in contextually unified segments, super-pixel-based approaches significantly mitigate the clutter, which is normal in pixel wise frameworks during scene understanding. Super-pixels allow customized shapes and variable size patches of connected components to be obtained. Furthermore, the computational time for these segmentation approaches can significantly decreased due to the reduced number of super-pixel target clusters. Hence, the super pixel-based approaches are more commonly used in robotics, computer vision and other intelligent systems. In this paper, we propose a Maximum Entropy scaled Super-Pixels (MEsSP) Segmentation method that encapsulates super-pixel segmentation based on an Entropy Model and utilizes local energy terms to label the pixels. Initially, after acquisition and pre-processing, image is segmented by two different methods: Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and MEsSP. Then, to extract the features from these segmented objects, the dynamic geometrical features, fast Fourier transform (FFT), blob extraction, Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) and KAZE features are extracted using the bag of features approach. Then, to categorize the objects, multiple kernel learning is applied. Finally, a deep belief network (DBN) assigns the relevant labels to the scenes based on the categorized objects, intersection over union scores and dice similarity coefficient. The experimental results regarding multiple objects recognition accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores over PASCAL VOC, Caltech 101 and UIUC Sports datasets show a remarkable performance. In addition, the evaluation of proposed scene recognition method over these benchmark datasets outperforms the state of the art (SOTA) methods.;;10.1007/s11042-022-13717-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13717-y;;;Bag of features, Deep belief network, Entropy-scaled segmentation, Super-pixels;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Design and development of virtual reality exposure therapy systems: requirements, challenges and solutions;e Zainab, Hijab and Bawany, Narmeen Zakaria and Rehman, Wajiha and Imran, Jaweria;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2023;ACM Digital Library;6137–6160;83;Virtual Reality technology is being utilized to administer psychotherapy treatments. Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) provides a safer and less expensive platform for the exposure therapy treatment of numerous anxiety disorders such as phobias. Though, research studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of VRET, its large scale adoption is yet to be realized. Many VRET solutions have been designed, however, few are widely used or commercially available. Moreover, these solutions lack standardization as there are no significant guidelines available for developing them. Consequently, it prevents the existing VRET systems from being adopted for clinical treatment. Thus, there is a need for determining the critical design requirements to create practically effective, safe and commercially viable VRET solutions. To this end, we put forward key design considerations in designing VRETs. Keeping in view these considerations, we present Defear, a therapist-led VRET solution to facilitate the treatment of phobias. Defear not only provides VRET solutions but also includes wide-ranging features including patient management, meditation, and progress tracking to support therapists in their exposure therapy treatments. Usability assessment showed that Defear was positively and highly rated by the users. Moreover, we also present the challenges in the planning, development, evaluation, and dissemination of VRET applications.;;10.1007/s11042-023-15756-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-023-15756-5;;;Virtual reality exposure therapy, Phobia, Therapist, Virtual reality, Exposure therapy, Psychologist;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;"Virtual Reality Collaboration Platform for&nbsp;Agile Software Development";Yigitbas, Enes and Witalinski, Iwo and Gottschalk, Sebastian and Engels, Gregor;;2023;ACM Digital Library;3–19;;Nowadays, most software teams use Scrum as their software development process framework. Scrum highly values collaboration and communication inside the team and aims to make them more flexible to spontaneous changes. However, due to the rise of working from home, many developers experienced a significant decrease in communication, social interactions, and a general feeling of social connectedness with their colleagues, which might impede the effectiveness of Scrum teams. To overcome these issues, we present a VR collaboration platform for Scrum meetings, called Virtual Reality-based Agile Collaboration Platform (VRACP). VRACP provides the visualization of and interaction with Scrum artifacts inside a realistic virtual office, the integration and synchronization of external data sources, remote collaboration, and human-like user representations. To evaluate whether VR can increase social connectedness in agile software development teams, we conducted a user study where our solution was compared to common web/desktop applications for Scrum meetings. The results suggest that although efficiency and effectiveness were reduced, it could indeed increase the feeling of being together, collaborating more naturally, and having more fun and motivation.;;10.1007/978-3-031-49266-2_1;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-49266-2_1;;;Virtual Reality, Agile Software Engineering, Scrum;Springer-Verlag;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Iterative Temporal-Spatial Transformer-based Cardiac T1 Mapping MRI Reconstruction;Lyu, Jun and Wang, Guangming and Hossain, M. Shamim;ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl.;2024;ACM Digital Library;;;The precise reconstruction of accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brings about notable clinical advantages, such as enhanced diagnostic precision and decreased examination costs. In contrast, traditional cardiac MRI necessitates repetitive acquisitions across multiple heartbeats, resulting in prolonged acquisition times. Significant strides have been made in accelerating MRI through deep learning-based reconstruction methods. However, these existing methods encounter certain limitations: (1) The intricate nature of heart reconstruction involving multiple complex time-series data and image information poses a challenge in exploring nonlinear dependencies between temporal contexts. (2) Existing research often overlooks weight sharing in iterative frameworks, impeding the effective capture of long-range or non-local information in the data and, consequently, limiting improvements in model performance. In order to improve cardiac MRI reconstruction, we propose a novel temporal-spatial transformer with a strategy in this study. We perform multi-level spatiotemporal information feature aggregation across multiple adjacent views, establishing nonlinear dependencies between features and efficiently learning important information between adjacent cardiac temporal frames, based on the multi-level encoder and decoder architecture of the transformer. Additionally, in order to improve contextual awareness between neighboring views, we add cross-view attention for temporal information interaction and fusion. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative strategy for training weights during the reconstruction process, which improves feature fusion in critical locations and reduces the number of computations required to calculate global feature dependencies. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the substantial superiority of this procedure over the most advanced techniques, suggesting that it has broad potential for clinical use.;;10.1145/3643640;https://doi.org/10.1145/3643640;;;Cardiac MRI reconstruction, Multi-level, Transformer, Temporal Information, T1 Mapping;Association for Computing Machinery;1551-6857;;Just Accepted;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Teaching gameful design;Kayali, Fares and Luckner, Naemi and Purgathofer, Peter;;2019;ACM Digital Library;;;This paper discusses the course 'Gameful Design' held as part of the computer science master curriculum at Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien). We argue that the challenge of meaningfully teaching serious game design and gamification design is not solved by solely imparting design guidelines. It is a matter of conveying a method of how to engage with a real-world problem, how to ideate and explore, and how to iterate and reflect on gameful design. We describe the three methodological cornerstones the course is built on - research-based teaching, design thinking and explorative design - and outline the format of the course. From a relective practice perspective, we give structured tangible advice how to run such a course in the form of guidelines and we describe the impact it had on our own research.;;10.1145/3337722.3341823;https://doi.org/10.1145/3337722.3341823;;;design thinking, explo rative design, gameful design, research-based teaching;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;"Self-supervised Indoor 360-Degree Depth Estimation via&nbsp;Structural Regularization";Kong, Weifeng and Zhang, Qiudan and Yang, You and Zhao, Tiesong and Wu, Wenhui and Wang, Xu;;2022;ACM Digital Library;438–451;;Estimating 360∘ depth information has attracted considerable attention due to the fast development of emerging 360∘ cameras. However, most researches only focus on dealing with the distortion of 360∘ images without considering the geometric information of 360∘ images, leading to poor performance. In this paper, we conduct to apply indoor structure regularities for self-supervised 360∘ image depth estimation. Specifically, we carefully design two geometric constraints for efficient model optimization including dominant direction normal constraint and planar consistency depth constraint. The dominant direction normal constraint enables to align the normal of indoor 360∘ images with the direction of vanishing points. The planar consistency depth constraint is utilized to fit the estimated depth of each pixel by its 3D plane. Hence, incorporating these two geometric constraints can further facilitate the generation of accurate depth results for 360∘ images. Extensive experiments illustrate that our designed method improves δ1 by an average of 4.82% compared to state-of-the-art methods on Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D datasets within 3D60.;;10.1007/978-3-031-20868-3_32;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20868-3_32;;;360∘ image, Depth estimation, Self-supervised learning, Structure regularity;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A graph-based approach for minimising the knowledge requirement of explainable recommender systems;Caro-Mart\'{\i}nez, Marta and Jim\'{e}nez-D\'{\i}az, Guillermo and Recio-Garcia, Juan A.;Knowl. Inf. Syst.;2023;ACM Digital Library;4379–4409;65;Traditionally, recommender systems use collaborative filtering or content-based approaches based on ratings and item descriptions. However, this information is unavailable in many domains and applications, and recommender systems can only tackle the problem using information about interactions or implicit knowledge. Within this scenario, this work proposes a novel approach based on link prediction techniques over graph structures that exclusively considers interactions between users and items to provide recommendations. We present and evaluate two alternative recommendation methods: one item-based and one user-based that apply the edge weight, common neighbours, Jaccard neighbours, Adar/Adamic, and Preferential Attachment link prediction techniques. This approach has two significant advantages, which are the novelty of our proposal. First, it is suitable for minimal knowledge scenarios where explicit data such as ratings or preferences are not available. However, as our evaluation demonstrates, this approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques using a similar level of interaction knowledge. Second, our approach has another relevant feature regarding one of the most significant concerns in current artificial intelligence research: the recommendation methods presented in this paper are easily interpretable for the users, improving their trust in the recommendations.;;10.1007/s10115-023-01903-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-023-01903-9;;;Explainable recommender systems, Interaction graphs, Link prediction techniques, Interpretability;Springer-Verlag;0219-1377;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A framework to design vocabulary-based serious games for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD);Khowaja, Kamran and Salim, Siti Salwah;Univers. Access Inf. Soc.;2020;ACM Digital Library;739–781;19;The use of serious games to help children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) learn different skills has increased in the recent past. Games, however, have not been exploited to enhance the vocabulary of these children. The serious game design framework (SGDF) and its components provide support throughout the design process, but there are no existing SGDFs that can be used to design serious games for these children to learn vocabulary skills. Therefore, in this research, a SGDF is proposed to overcome the problem of designing serious games for children with ASD. The components of the framework were identified after an extensive review of the literature on ASD and existing SGDFs. The input, process and output model was used as an underlying structure of the framework, and the identified components were logically placed in each phase of the model. The proposed framework was iteratively evaluated through expert reviews with academic experts and researchers working in the area of serious games, as well as game designers. The modified version of the framework was produced based on the comments provided by experts. This modified version was then used in the applicability evaluation of the framework with researchers and game designers. A proposed SGDF was produced based on the comments of experts. The main findings from expert reviews show that the structure, components and details of the proposed framework have been effectively refined. The use of the framework to produce serious game design and the prototype demonstrates its use in real time. The evaluation of the prototype with autistic children shows the improvement in their vocabulary learning before and after using the prototype.;;10.1007/s10209-019-00689-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-019-00689-4;;;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Language comprehension skills, Vocabulary, Computer-based intervention (CBI), Serious game design, Prototype development, Virtual reality, Augmented reality;Springer-Verlag;1615-5289;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Successfully applying Industry 4.0 requires the cooperation of various stakeholders from different domains. Domain-specific modeling languages promise to facilitate their involvement through leveraging (domain-specific) models to primary development artifacts. We aim to assess the use of modeling in Industry 4.0 through the lens of modeling languages in a broad sense. Based on an extensive literature review, we updated our systematic mapping study on modeling languages and modeling techniques used in Industry 4.0 &nbsp;(Wortmann et al., Conference on model-driven engineering languages and systems (MODELS’17), IEEE, pp 281–291, 2017) to include publications until February 2018. Overall, the updated study considers 3344 candidate publications that were systematically investigated until 408 relevant publications were identified. Based on these, we developed an updated map of the research landscape on modeling languages and techniques for Industry 4.0. Research on modeling languages in Industry 4.0 focuses on contributing methods to solve the challenges of digital representation and integration. To this end, languages from systems engineering and knowledge representation are applied most often but rarely combined. There also is a gap between the communities researching and applying modeling languages for Industry 4.0 that originates from different perspectives on modeling and related standards. From the vantage point of modeling, Industry 4.0 is the combination of systems engineering, with cyber-physical systems, and knowledge engineering.

;Reaching out to the future;;;2019;ACM Digital Library;;;The first course in software engineering is the most critical. Education must start from an understanding of the heart of software development, from familiar ground that is common to all software development endeavors. This book is an in-depth introduction to software engineering that uses a systematic, universal kernel to teach the essential elements of all software engineering methods.This kernel, Essence, is a vocabulary for defining methods and practices. Essence was envisioned and originally created by Ivar Jacobson and his colleagues, developed by Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) and approved by The Object Management Group (OMG) as a standard in 2014. Essence is a practiceindependent framework for thinking and reasoning about the practices we have and the practices we need. Essence establishes a shared and standard understanding of what is at the heart of software development. Essence is agnostic to any particular method, lifecycle independent, programming language independent, concise, scalable, extensible, and formally specified. Essence frees the practices from their method prisons.The first part of the book describes Essence, the essential elements to work with, the essential things to do and the essential competencies you need when developing software. The other three parts describe more and more advanced use cases of Essence. Using real but manageable examples, it covers the fundamentals of Essence and the innovative use of serious games to support software engineering. It also explains how current practices such as user stories, use cases, Scrum, and microservices can be described using Essence, and illustrates how their activities can be represented using the Essence notions of cards and checklists. The fourth part of the book offers a vision how Essence can be scaled to support large, complex systems engineering.Essence is supported by an ecosystem developed and maintained by a community of experienced people worldwide. From this ecosystem, professors and students can select what they need and create their own way of working, thus learning how to create ONE way of working that matches the particular situation and needs.;;;https://doi.org/10.1145/3277669.3277697;;;;"Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan &amp; Claypool";;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

However, drastic visual discrepancies between an onsite query image and prerecorded indoor images cast a significant challenge for visual localization. In this paper, based on the key observation of the constant existence of planar surfaces such as floors or walls in indoor scenes, we propose a novel system incorporating geometric information to address issues using only pixelated images. Through the system implementation, we contribute a hierarchical structure consisting of pre-scanned images and point cloud, as well as a distilled representation of the planar-element layout extracted from the original dataset. A view synthesis procedure is designed to generate synthetic images as complementary to that of a sparsely sampled dataset. Moreover, a global image descriptor based on the image statistic modality, called block mean, variance, and color (BMVC), was employed to speed up the candidate pose identification incorporated with a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptor. Experimental results on a popular benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visual localization validity and accuracy.;;10.1007/s11390-021-1373-1;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-021-1373-1;;;visual localization, planar surface, statistic information, view synthesis;Springer-Verlag;1000-9000;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This bibliometric review addresses gamification’s current and future relevance in the educational field, focusing on its use as a pedagogical strategy to improve the learning and engagement of children with disabilities. Sixty-six studies published between 2001 and 2023 were analyzed, evaluating the most influential articles, main keywords, prominent authors, collaborating institutions, and funding sources. The literature suggests that gamification offers inclusive and personalized learning opportunities covering various disabilities. Methodologies and approaches to implement gamification were identified, including game elements, user-centered design techniques, and emerging technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and educational robotics. However, challenges and areas for improvement were also found, such as the need for more long-term empirical evidence and the importance of considering individual differences and specific needs when designing gamification strategies. The review highlights the importance of strengthening collaborative networks between researchers and education professionals to disseminate best practices and promote more effective gamification approaches adapted to the needs of children with disabilities.

Syst.;2021;ACM Digital Library;2479–2511;63;With the access devices that are densely deployed in multi-access edge computing environments, users frequently switch access devices when moving, which causes the imbalance of network load and the decline of service quality. To solve the problems above, a seamless handover scheme for wireless access points based on perception is proposed. First, a seamless handover model based on load perception is proposed to solve the unbalanced network load, in which a seamless handover algorithm for wireless access points is used to calculate the access point with the highest weight, and a software-defined network controller controls the switching process. A joint allocation method of communication and computing resources based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to minimize the terminal energy consumption and the system delay. A resource allocation model is based on minimizing terminal energy consumption, and system delay is built. The optimal value of task offloading decision and resource allocation vector are calculated with deep reinforcement learning.

Educ.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1–13;19;The quality education goal is a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) that the United Nations aim to achieve by 2023. While there is still a long way to go to achieve the goal, information and communications technologies (ICT) provide efficient tools to substantially strengthen and accelerate the process. Thus, in this chapter, the authors design an Internet+ education platform to facilitate all participants conducting quality education effectively and efficiently, providing extensive intelligent quality education tools by exploiting various ICT. Functions provided by the platform can be conveniently used by each user over any kind of end devices, which helps to increase the interests of students and younger teachers in learning and education. In addition, taking the academic success as a case, they study factors influencing the quality education effect by machine learning algorithms on the platform. They propose an LR-based algorithm to predict the academic success of undergraduates to find quality education issues. Experiment results verify the superior performance of the LR-based algorithm.;;10.4018/IJICTE.330251;https://doi.org/10.4018/IJICTE.330251;;;ICT, Quality Education, Sustainable Development Goal;IGI Global;1550-1876;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Deep Neuro-Evolution: Evolving Neural Network for Character Locomotion Controller;Zhu, Zhongguan and Guo, Shihui and Liao, Minghong;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;;Designing the controller to actuate the virtual character is challenging given the high dimensions of both character states and controls. Flexible user control is normally required in interactive applications (virtual and augmented reality), which further adds to constructing a motion controller for the virtual characters. Although deep neural networks showed their potential in tackling this problem, existing works based on neural networks normally require the manual design of the network architecture, which requires professional experience and a trial-and-error process. This paper proposes an automatic solution to optimize both the topology and connection weights of the deep neural network, used as a character locomotion controller. This method mimics the evolution process in nature, evaluates individual fitness, and generates the individuals for the next generation while maintaining the current generation's fitness level. We show that this method is convenient to construct the locomotion controller for virtual characters on a general basis.;;10.1145/3469213.3470259;https://doi.org/10.1145/3469213.3470259;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Automated Mapping of Adaptive App GUIs from Phones to TVs;Hu, Han and Dong, Ruiqi and Grundy, John and Nguyen, Thai Minh and Liu, Huaxiao and Chen, Chunyang;ACM Trans. Softw. Eng. Methodol.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;33;With the increasing interconnection of smart devices, users often desire to adopt the same app on quite different devices for identical tasks, such as watching the same movies on both their smartphones and TVs. However, the significant differences in screen size, aspect ratio, and interaction styles make it challenging to adapt Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) across these devices. Although there are millions of apps available on Google Play, only a few thousand are designed to support smart TV displays. Existing techniques to map a mobile app GUI to a TV either adopt a responsive design, which struggles to bridge the substantial gap between phone and TV, or use mirror apps for improved video display, which requires hardware support and extra engineering efforts. Instead of developing another app for supporting TVs, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate corresponding adaptive TV GUIs, given the phone GUIs as the input. Based on our empirical study of GUI pairs for TVs and phones in existing apps, we synthesize a list of rules for grouping and classifying phone GUIs, converting them to TV GUIs, and generating dynamic TV layouts and source code for the TV display. Our tool is not only beneficial to developers but also to GUI designers, who can further customize the generated GUIs for their TV app development. An evaluation and user study demonstrate the accuracy of our generated GUIs and the usefulness of our tool.;;10.1145/3631968;https://doi.org/10.1145/3631968;;;Graphic user interface, cross-screen, adaptive GUI;Association for Computing Machinery;1049-331X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;An Energy-efficient and Privacy-aware Decomposition Framework for Edge-assisted Federated Learning;Shi, Yimin and Duan, Haihan and Yang, Lei and Cai, Wei;ACM Trans. Sen. Netw.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;18;Deep Learning (DL) is an essential technology for modern intelligent sensor network and interactive multimedia applications, having problems with user data privacy when training on a central cloud. While Federated Learning (FL) motivates to preserve user privacy, it also causes new problems of lower user terminal usability and training efficiency, which caused substantial energy consumption. This article proposes a novel energy-efficient and privacy-aware decomposition framework to improve user-side FL efficiency under pre-defined privacy requirements with the assistance of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Software Decomposition. It takes the propagation of each neural layer as the migrating unit and considers the tradeoff relationship between privacy and efficiency. We also propose an online scheduling algorithm to optimize the framework’s training performance. Furthermore, we summarize eight privacy-sensitive information classes on which existing privacy attacks base and design configurable privacy preservation mechanisms for each class. Simulations and experiments prove the effectiveness of our framework and algorithm in FL efficiency improvement and the effects of different privacy constraints on the overall training efficiency.;;10.1145/3522741;https://doi.org/10.1145/3522741;;;Mobile edge computing, software decomposition, federated learning, distributed computing;Association for Computing Machinery;1550-4859;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

A key question for workflow scheduling in the edge computing environment is how to guarantee user-perceived quality of services when the supporting edge services and resources are with unstable, time-variant, and fluctuant performance. In this work, we study the workflow scheduling problem in the multi-user edge computing environment and propose a Deep-Q-Network (DQN) -based multi-workflow scheduling approach which is capable of handling time-varying performance of edge services. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct a simulative case study and compare ours with other existing methods.

;A College Music Teaching System Designed Based on Android Platform;Sun, Sibing and Usman, Muhammad;Sci. Program.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;2021;Today’s rapid evolution in information and communication technologies affects all sectors, including education, and has a positive impact. As a result, teachers need to use technology effectively and keep up with innovation to meet the needs of the next generation. The college music educational system was always an important part of higher education in China, and the corresponding music curriculum system has gradually been established. This curriculum system has been instrumental in the systematization and standardization of China’s music industry, and it has produced a large number of outstanding musical talents for the country. The goal of this research is to discover advanced and dependable teaching methods. With the growing popularity of mobile intelligent terminal devices and the expanding application of the Android platform, using a mobile intelligent terminal for university courses’ learning has become a more powerful technical feature. Through the development of an intelligent learning application using the Android intelligent platform, students can practice exercises and evaluate themselves, allowing them to analyze their weak points based on their evaluation value, whether in class or after class, and then facilitate their learning. In this paper, I present my original perspectives and proposals on music education in colleges and universities, based on literature, analysis, and study, as well as my years of practical experience. To assure stability of the suggested framework, scalability, and sustainability, I have used the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. This framework is based on the mobile client of Android that teaches and queries college music remotely and controls smart music. According to the experimental data, online music teaching has a greater learning effect on music skills and enhances traditional music performance by 25%. In terms of increasing interest in musical courses, this online college teaching information platform has the ability to raise 74% of students’ awareness.;;10.1155/2021/7460924;https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7460924;;;;Hindawi Limited;1058-9244;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Although extensive work explores different adaptation policies, XR creators often struggle with their implementation, which involves laborious manual scripting. The few available tools are underdeveloped for realistic XR settings where it is often necessary to consider conflicting aspects that affect an adaptation. We fill this gap by presenting AUIT, a toolkit that facilitates the design of optimization-based adaptation policies. AUIT allows creators to flexibly combine policies that address common objectives in XR applications, such as element reachability, visibility, and consistency. Instead of using rules or scripts, specifying adaptation policies via adaptation objectives simplifies the design process and enables creative exploration of adaptations. After creators decide which adaptation objectives to use, a multi-objective solver finds appropriate adaptations in real-time. A study showed that AUIT allowed creators of XR applications to quickly and easily create high-quality adaptations.;;10.1145/3526113.3545651;https://doi.org/10.1145/3526113.3545651;;;adaptive user interfaces, context-awareness, extended reality, multi-objective optimization, toolkit;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Flying colors: Using color blindness simulations in the development of accessible mobile games;Pinheiro, Mateus and Viana, Windson and Andrade, Rossana M. C. and Darin, Ticianne;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;;Video games are an important part of modern culture, particularly after the popularization of mobile devices, and should, therefore, be accessible to all people. However, even with the advancement of mobile accessibility, players with visual disabilities still face barriers due to the inherent focus of games on visual stimuli. In this context, color blind players are affected by how colors are used in the interfaces, especially when these colors are the basis for essential game mechanics. Some challenging aspects are the limited availability of color blind test subjects and the importance to identify and consider accessibility threats even in the early stages of development. Thus, digital simulations emerge as possible assets to increase accessibility and awareness. In order to assess the impact of using color blindness simulations during the process of developing mobile games, this work presents an experiment using simulations in two platforms - desktop and augmented reality - on the development of a real mobile game. Results show that the use of simulations can help designers and developers, even those with low interface evaluation experience, not only to find problematic areas on the interface but also to adapt and create accessible mechanics on the main gameplay. Further, it increases awareness contributing for a more inclusive game industry. We also discuss the particularities of different types of simulation and how they can possibly be integrated to a game development process.;;10.1145/3472301.3484353;https://doi.org/10.1145/3472301.3484353;;;accessibility, color blindness, games, mobile;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Immersive Multimedia Service Caching in Edge Cloud with Renewable Energy;Hossain, M. Shamim and Hao, Yixue and Hu, Long and Liu, Jia and Wei, Gang and Chen, Min;ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl.;2024;ACM Digital Library;;;Immersive service caching, based on the intelligent edge cloud, can meet delay-sensitive service requirements. Although numerous service caching solutions for edge clouds have been designed, they have not been well explored. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work to consider the immersive service caching scheme under the supply of renewable energy. In this paper, we investigate the service caching problem under the renewable energy supply to minimize service latency while making full use of renewable energy. Specifically, we formulate the service caching and renewable energy harvesting problem, which considers the dynamic renewable energy, unknown service requests, and limited capacity of the edge cloud. To solve this problem, we propose an effective online learning algorithm, called OSCRE. Our algorithm first uses Lyapunov optimization to convert the time-average problem into time-independence optimization and thus realizes optimal renewable energy harvesting. Then, it realizes the service caching scheme using data-driven combinatorial multi-armed bandit learning. The simulation results show that the OSCRE scheme can save service latency while making sufficient use of renewable energy.;;10.1145/3643818;https://doi.org/10.1145/3643818;;;"Edge cloud, Intelligent scheduling; Renewable Energy, Multimedia Service caching.";Association for Computing Machinery;1551-6857;;Just Accepted;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

While so far almost only the technologies themselves have been considered, we explore the underlying software development and programming approaches. We therefore conduct a detailed media content analysis of twenty-seven movies that examines the role of software development in science fiction by identifying and investigating new approaches to programming and how software development is conceptualized portrayed within science fiction scenes. With the additional analysis of eighteen design fiction stories exploring the scenario “What if everyone is able to program?”, we envision potential impacts of the democratization of software development on business and society.

;VRGit: A Version Control System for Collaborative Content Creation in Virtual Reality;Zhang, Lei and Agrawal, Ashutosh and Oney, Steve and Guo, Anhong;;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;"Immersive authoring tools allow users to intuitively create and manipulate 3D scenes while immersed in Virtual Reality (VR). Collaboratively designing these scenes is a creative process that involves numerous edits, explorations of design alternatives, and frequent communication with collaborators. Version Control Systems (VCSs) help users achieve this by keeping track of the version history and creating a shared hub for communication. However, most VCSs are unsuitable for managing the version history of VR content because their underlying line differencing mechanism is designed for text and lacks the semantic information of 3D content; and the widely adopted commit model is designed for asynchronous collaboration rather than real-time awareness and communication in VR. We introduce VRGit, a new collaborative VCS that visualizes version history as a directed graph composed of 3D miniatures, and enables users to easily navigate versions, create branches, as well as preview and reuse versions directly in VR. Beyond individual uses, VRGit also facilitates synchronous collaboration in VR by providing awareness of users’ activities and version history through portals and shared history visualizations. In a lab study with 14 participants (seven groups), we demonstrate that VRGit enables users to easily manage version history both individually and collaboratively in VR.";;10.1145/3544548.3581136;https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3581136;;;Collaboration, Version Control System, Virtual Reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Why cloud applications are not ready for the edge (yet);Nguyen, Chanh and Mehta, Amardeep and Klein, Cristian and Elmroth, Erik;;2019;ACM Digital Library;250–263;;Mobile Edge Clouds (MECs) are distributed platforms in which distant data-centers are complemented with computing and storage capacity located at the edge of the network. Their wide resource distribution enables MECs to fulfill the need of low latency and high bandwidth to offer an improved user experience.As modern cloud applications are increasingly architected as collections of small, independently deployable services, they can be flexibly deployed in various configurations that combines resources from both centralized datacenters and edge locations. In principle, such applications should therefore be well-placed to exploit the advantages of MECs so as to reduce service response times.In this paper, we quantify the benefits of deploying such cloud micro-service applications on MECs. Using two popular benchmarks, we show that, against conventional wisdom, end-to-end latency does not improve significantly even when most application services are deployed in the edge location. We developed a profiler to better understand this phenomenon, allowing us to develop recommendations for adapting applications to MECs. Further, by quantifying the gains of those recommendations, we show that the performance of an application can be made to reach the ideal scenario, in which the latency between an edge datacenter and a remote datacenter has no impact on the application performance.This work thus presents ways of adapting cloud-native applications to take advantage of MECs and provides guidance for developing MEC-native applications. We believe that both these elements are necessary to drive MEC adoption.;;10.1145/3318216.3363298;https://doi.org/10.1145/3318216.3363298;;;edge latency, micro-service, mobile application development, mobile edge clouds, profiling;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

These platforms are prepared to parse and check source code written in a variety of general-purpose programming languages. The emergence of domain-specific languages enables professionals from different areas to develop and describe problem solutions in their disciplines. Thus, source code quality analysis methods and tools can also be applied to software artefacts developed with a domain-specific language. To evaluate the quality of domain-specific language code, every software component required by the quality platform to parse and query the source code must be developed. This becomes a time-consuming and error-prone task, for which this paper describes a model-driven interoperability strategy that bridges the gap between the grammar formats of source code quality parsers and domain-specific text languages.

;Participatory Design to Create Digital Technologies for Batik Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Case of iWareBatik;Permatasari, Puspita Ayu and Cantoni, Lorenzo;;2021;ACM Digital Library;88–106;;Heritage communication is more and more integrating digital media, which help to offer a wider and deeper understanding of heritage and its values. In particular, intangible cultural heritage (ICH) can find in information and communication technologies a powerful ally to share its facets and different dimensions, through multimedia technologies (especially videos), storytelling, and several other applications like mixed realities and artificial intelligence.Such media can help not only to provide access to information and knowledge, but also to enrich the experience of people exposed to such heritage, and to promote a deep connection between the heritage itself and interested persons.This paper presents the process through which goals and needs to communicate and promote Indonesian Batik textile heritage, which has been inscribed by UNESCO among the Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2009, have been collected and transformed into the design of digital communication outlets, namely a website and a mobile app. Such process has encompassed an extensive analysis of the presence itself of Batik in digital media through benchmarking, as well as the elicitation of needs and requirements of relevant stakeholders and target audiences, through in-depth interviews and surveys. The design has been done ensuring at every step that it was considering and integrating, as much as possible, the results of the previous analyses.

;Toward a new approach for sorting extremely large data files in the big data era;Shatnawi, Ali and AlZahouri, Yathrip and Shehab, Mohammed A. and Jararweh, Yaser and Al-Ayyoub, Mahmoud;Cluster Computing;2019;ACM Digital Library;819–828;22;The extensive amount of data and contents generated today will require a paradigm shift in processing and management techniques for these data. One of the important data processing operations is the data sorting. Using multiple passes in external merge sort has a great influence on speeding up the sorting of extremely large data files. Since in large files, the swapping time is dominant in many applications, algorithms that minimize the swapping operations are normally superior to those which only focus on CPU time optimizations. In sorting extremely large files, external algorithms, such as the merge sort, are normally used. It is shown that using multiple passes over the data set, as proposed in our algorithm, has resulted in a great improvement in the number of swaps, thus, reducing the overall sorting time. Moreover, the proposed technique is suitable to be used with the emerging parallelization techniques such as GPUs.

;An adaptive function placement in serverless computing;Xu, Donghong and Sun, Zhongbin;Cluster Computing;2022;ACM Digital Library;3161–3174;25;Serverless computing is a new fine-grained computing and deploying paradigm which combined terminal devices, edge nodes and cloud data center into a complete computing system. Stateless function is the critical factor to implement serverless computing. For optimizing the function execution, function placement is becoming the urgent problem to be solved in the serverless computing. To specify what is function placement in serverless computing, an adaptive function placement framework is presented. For prejudging the trend of function placement, positive or negative properties of event are classed. Based on the positive or negative impact on the function placement decision and function placement trend, mathematical model of function placement is presented for the first time. For specifying the adaptive function placement in serverless computing, An adaptive function placement model is formulated based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In the model, function states space, placement rate, placement probability, decision time, action set, cost and criterion are presented for the first time to specify the computation of the function’s MDP.The presented algorithm decides function execution in terminal devices,local edge nodes or the function execution in the remote available cloud servers in a real time and adaptive way. The presented algorithm also permits dynamically allocating functions to minimize the Dec(t) while keeping performance satisfaction. Evaluation and experiment show the presented adaptive function placement algorithm can get the satisfied requirements of different indexes.;;10.1007/s10586-021-03506-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03506-x;;;Serverless computing, Stateless function, Function placement, Agent;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1386-7857;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Deep Neuro-Fuzzy System application trends, challenges, and future perspectives: a systematic survey;Talpur, Noureen and Abdulkadir, Said Jadid and Alhussian, Hitham and Hasan, Mohd Hilmi and Aziz, Norshakirah and Bamhdi, Alwi;Artif. Intell. Rev.;2022;ACM Digital Library;865–913;56;"Deep neural networks (DNN) have remarkably progressed in applications involving large and complex datasets but have been criticized as a black-box. This downside has recently become a motivation for the research community to pursue the ideas of hybrid approaches, resulting in novel hybrid systems classified as deep neuro-fuzzy systems (DNFS). Studies regarding the implementation of DNFS have rapidly increased in the domains of computing, healthcare, transportation, and finance with high interpretability and reasonable accuracy. However, relatively few survey studies have been found in the literature to provide a comprehensive insight into this domain. Therefore, this study aims to perform a systematic review to evaluate the current progress, trends, arising issues, research gaps, challenges, and future scope related to DNFS studies. A study mapping process was prepared to guide a systematic search for publications related to DNFS published between 2015 and 2020 using five established scientific directories. As a result, a total of 105 studies were identified and critically analyzed to address research questions with the objectives: (i) to understand the concept of DNFS; (ii) to find out DNFS optimization methods; (iii) to visualize the intensity of work carried out in DNFS domain; and (iv) to highlight DNFS application subjects and domains. We believe that this study provides up-to-date guidance for future research in the DNFS domain, allowing for more effective advancement in techniques and processes. The analysis made in this review proves that DNFS-based research is actively growing with a substantial implementation and application scope in the future.";;10.1007/s10462-022-10188-3;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-022-10188-3;;;Big data, Classification systems, Deep neuro-fuzzy systems, Deep neural network, Fuzzy systems, Optimization methods;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0269-2821;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Experts Evaluation of Usability for Digital Solutions Directed at Older Adults: a Scoping Review of Reviews;Silva, Anabela and Isabel Martins, Ana and Caravau, Hilma and Margarida Almeida, Ana and Silva, Telmo and Ribeiro, \'{O}scar and Santinha, Gon\c{c}alo and Rocha, Nelson;;2021;ACM Digital Library;174–181;;"Background: it is important to standardize the evaluation and reporting procedures across usability studies to guide researchers, facilitate comparisons, and promote high-quality studies. A first step to standardizing is to have an overview of how experts-based usability evaluation studies are reported across the literature. Objectives: to describe and synthesize the procedures of usability evaluation by experts that are being reported to conduct inspection usability assessments of digital solutions relevant for older adults. Methods: a scoping review of reviews was performed using a five-stage methodology to identify and describe relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 as follows: i) identification of the research question; ii) identification of relevant studies; iii) select studies for review; iv) charting of data from selected literature; and v) collation, summary, and report of results. The research was conducted on five electronic databases: PubMed, ACM Digital Library, IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The articles that met the inclusion criteria were identified, and data extracted for further analysis, including evaluators, current usability inspection methods, and instruments to support usability inspection methods. Results: a total of 3958 articles were identified. After a detailed screening, 12 reviews matched the eligibility criteria. Conclusion: overall, we found a variety of unstandardized procedures and a lack of detail on some important aspects of the assessment, including a thorough description of the evaluators and of the instruments used to facilitate the inspection evaluation such as heuristics checklists. These findings suggest the need for a consensus framework on the experts’ assessment of usability that informs researchers and allows standardization of procedures.";;10.1145/3439231.3439238;https://doi.org/10.1145/3439231.3439238;;;Digital solutions, Experts’-based usability, Heuristics, Inspection methods, Older adults, Scoping review, Usability;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Investigating security indicators for hyperlinking within the metaverse;Windl, Maximiliane and Scheidle, Anna and George, Ceenu and Mayer, Sven;;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;Security indicators, such as the padlock icon indicating SSL encryption in browsers, are established mechanisms to convey secure connections. Currently, such indicators mainly exist for browsers and mobile environments. With the rise of the metaverse, we investigate how to mark secure transitions between applications in virtual reality to so-called sub-metaverses. For this, we first conducted in-depth interviews with domain experts (N=8) to understand the general design dimensions for security indicators in virtual reality (VR). Using these insights and considering additional design constraints, we implemented the five most promising indicators and evaluated them in a user study (N=25). While the visual blinking indicator placed in the periphery performed best regarding accuracy and task completion time, participants subjectively preferred the static visual indicator above the portal. Moreover, the latter received high scores regarding understandability while still being rated low regarding intrusiveness and disturbance. Our findings contribute to a more secure and enjoyable metaverse experience.;;;;;;;USENIX Association;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Distributional characteristics of Dimensions concepts: An Empirical Analysis using Zipf’s law;Gupta, Solanki and Singh, Vivek Kumar;Scientometrics;2024;ACM Digital Library;1037–1053;129;The massive growth in scholarly outputs during the last few decades has resulted into the creation of several scholarly databases to index the outputs. These scholarly databases index publication records and provide different metadata fields for different kinds of usage ranging from retrieval and research evaluation to various scientometric analysis. The ‘author keywords’ is one such important metadata field provided by many databases and used for different text-based and thematic structure analysis. The Dimensions database, however, does not provide ‘author keywords’ metadata field, instead it provides automatically generated terms from the article full texts, called ‘concepts’. Therefore, it is not clear whether different text-based analysis can be done with data provided by Dimensions database. Therefore, this article explores the distributional characteristics of Dimensions concepts. The Dimensions concept data obtained for a sufficiently large sample of scholarly articles is analysed through rank frequency distribution plots in the log–log space. Existence of Zipfian distribution is explored. The results indicate that Dimensions concepts adhere to the Zipfian properties which in turn indicates that Dimensions concepts have similar distributional characteristics as author keywords and hence they may have the same expressive power as that of author or index keywords for scientometric exercises. The study is novel as it is the first study to explore the distributional characteristics of the Dimensions concepts, particularly with respect to Zipfian properties, which provide the statistical foundation for understanding the Dimensions concepts and help to model and analyse them.;;10.1007/s11192-023-04899-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-023-04899-9;;;Dimensions database, Dimensions concepts, Distributional characteristics, Zipf’s law;Springer-Verlag;0138-9130;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Design of Smart Classroom System Based on Internet of Things Technology and Smart Classroom;Zhang, Mingbao and Li, Xiang and Tsai, Sang-Bing;Mob. Inf. Syst.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;2021;Smart classroom teaching is one of the new teaching methods. With the support of technology, teaching is carried out with the help of smart teaching tools to enhance teacher-student communication, enhance students’ learning autonomy, and provide new ideas for the realization of students’ deep learning. How to promote the overall intelligence of the teaching environment so that the teaching equipment can be used more efficiently and managed more effectively has become the main concern of schools. This article mainly studies the smart classroom system based on the Internet of Things technology and smart classroom. For temperature detection, we mainly use the DS18B20 chip to detect the temperature in the classroom. For the light intensity of the classroom, we use a photoresistor to collect the light data, and after amplification by the amplifier, the A/D sampling process of the single-chip microcomputer is used to obtain the light intensity, combined with the clock module to distinguish the influence of the classroom light. The data collection adopts the method of directly observing the source data, and the data format has not undergone secondary conversion, which ensures the accuracy of the source data. This test uses the USR-TCP232 network debugging assistant to debug the data collection. To optimize the safety and reliability of the system, dual-computer backup switching is adopted on the hardware, and process monitoring and management strategies are adopted on the software. At the same time, the amount of data interaction in the smart classroom is relatively large, so it is necessary to build a highly available cluster server, so that the system not only has a certain degree of stability, but also can quickly respond to users’ access requests. We can calculate that the average transmission time is about 10 ms, and 99.9% of the data transmission delay is less than 30 ms. The results show that the Internet of Things and smart classroom provide great convenience for future smart campus construction, daily teaching, and campus management and can also provide reference for the construction of smart classrooms in other universities.;;10.1155/2021/5438878;https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5438878;;;;IOS Press;1574-017X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A board game to improve freshmen on computer networks: Beyond layers abstraction;Ramos, J\'{u}lio Cesar and L’Erario, Alexandre and Mendon\c{c}a, Marcio and Fabri, Jos\'{e} Augusto and Pal\'{a}cios, Rodrigo Henrique Cunha;Education and Information Technologies;2023;ACM Digital Library;11167–11191;28;"The freshman student’s perspective on the activities performed in a data center by the network analyst is complex and intricate. These activities include the configuration of equipment and the connection between network devices. There are several issues with these activities that demand technical knowledge. Questions such as: ”what does this equipment do?”; ”How is it connected to another?”; ”How is it configured?” can be complicated for beginner students. Moreover, these technical questions are also associated with scalability, availability, security, portability, accounting, and costs. These resources require technical knowledge and also how to aggregate them into a network solution. We applied an abstraction set to mitigate these issues for first-year students and created the Network Analyst Board Game. This board game introduces students to the computer network field geared toward Data Center activities. The objective of this paper is to report this game. The students obtained essential theoretical and practical knowledge regarding computer networks after playing. A quasi-experiment was conducted with a set of students from the computing courses. After these experiments, more interactivity was noted among the students, resulting from the game mechanics applied. Therefore, in addition to increasing their interest in the area, the students elaborated more complex questions.

;Visualizing Orientations of Large Numbers of Photographs;Niebling, Florian;;2019;ACM Digital Library;1–2;;"Digitized historical photographs are invaluable sources and key items for scholars in Cultural Heritage (CH) research. In addition to browsing online image collections using metadata, alternative ways of finding photographs are possible, by embedding the documents into spatial and temporal contexts to provide interactive access to these vast resources. Towards this goal, spatial properties of photographic items, i.e. position and orientation of the camera, can be automatically estimated using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms, even on historical photographs. In the talk we will introduce a web-based 4D browser environment that enables architectural historians to answer spatial research questions, such as ""Which buildings were photographed more (or less) often than others"", ""From which directions has a point of interest been photographed?"", ""Is there one main preferred direction?"" Existing methods to visualize spatial properties of images statistically are limited. Although traditional visualization methods - such as heat maps - can be used to show positional distribution of large numbers of images, it is still not widely explored how to visualize distributions of their orientations. We will discuss visualization techniques for interactively browsing spatialized photographs to gain knowledge from a combination of historical depictions of buildings and corresponding 3D models of historic cityscapes. We present first adaptations of visualization methods from other application domains that also address orientation, towards offering supporting tools to historians with corresponding spatial research questions. The introduced differentiation of occuring imaging phenomena can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different visualization methods in empirical user studies.";;10.1145/3347317.3352729;https://doi.org/10.1145/3347317.3352729;;;historical photographs, media repositories, scientific visualization;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Casdoc: unobtrusive explanations in code examples;Nassif, Mathieu and Horlacher, Zara and Robillard, Martin P.;;2022;ACM Digital Library;631–635;;Code examples are of great value to programmers trying to learn an unfamiliar API. Effective code examples are often surrounded with plain text explanations of the relevant concepts, techniques, and API elements involved in the example. However, authoring concise yet complete explanations is a challenging balancing act. To address this challenge, we propose Casdoc, a novel authoring technique and presentation format for annotated code examples. Casdoc-formatted code examples are HTML documents designed to embed unobtrusive explanations into the code. They thus contain more explanations to address the varying needs of a larger audience, without disrupting individual readers with information they already know. Explanations are split into short annotations and organized into an intuitive tree-like structure, thus supporting a streamlined authoring process. We used Casdoc to produce 105 Java code examples as part of the course material for an undergraduate computer science course. Students preferred the new format over traditional code examples. Their interaction with code examples suggests that the intuitive structure of Casdoc annotations reduces the need for navigation aids such as search fields.On-line tool and video: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/casdoc/;;10.1145/3524610.3527875;https://doi.org/10.1145/3524610.3527875;;;code examples, documentation format, software documentation;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This article proposes to go beyond “interaction” and toward a paradigm of human-computer integration. The potential of this paradigm is demonstrated through three prototypes: Inter-Dream, a system that integrates with the brain's autonomic physiological processes to drive users toward healthy sleep states; Neo-Noumena, a system that integrates with the user's affective neurophysiology to augment the interpersonal communication of emotion; and PsiNet, a system that integrates interpersonal brain activity to amplify human connection.

We show that sandboxes are most useful if a subtle balance is created between freedom to experiment, and minimising required knowledge and effort to implement a concept. Also, a large number of examples illustrating the capabilities of the sandbox should be given, and sandboxes should be clearly assigned to concepts taught in class. The technology was used with a class of 284 students and our evaluation and survey results (n=57) show that students found the sandboxes helpful for learning and preparing them for the assessments.

Technol.;2019;ACM Digital Library;1294–1306;34;"Artistic augmentation of photographs with water droplets aims at generating aesthetic yet realistic images, and thus differs from traditional augmented reality in two aspects. One difference lies in the adoption of a new image as the environment map in order to render reflected or refracted effects on the surface of inserted water droplets. The other difference is in modeling of water droplets including hanging droplets and resting droplets. These differences raise two research challenges: 1) how to adjust the brightness and colors of the new environment map to maintain visual consistency between the new environment map and the original input image; 2) how to model hanging and resting droplets aesthetically. This paper proposes a framework that addresses these two challenges and demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework by generating example augmented images.";;10.1007/s11390-019-1976-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-019-1976-y;;;image-based modeling, droplet modeling, illumination estimation, augmented reality, artistic augmentation;Springer-Verlag;1000-9000;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Mobile learning for hearing-impaired children: Review and analysis;Herrera, Susana I. and Manresa-Yee, Cristina and Sanz, Cecilia V.;Univers. Access Inf. Soc.;2021;ACM Digital Library;635–653;22;"Currently, a common objective for most countries is including people with disabilities in the various aspects of everyday life. As part of this objective, access to computer technologies that can help improve the learning of these people should be considered. In the case of hearing impairment, cochlear implants allow children with severe or profound hearing loss to develop natural language, which increases their chances of insertion in mainstream schools. However, the success of this depends on the auditory training process that involves various professionals and family members surrounding the implanted child. In this context, the use of mobile technologies has advantages due to their low cost and ubiquity; using mobile phones, children could learn new concepts as they train their hearing skills. Considering the above, in this paper, we present a review of mobile applications that hearing-impaired people can use for their learning and auditory training. The review is organized in two parts: (a) a systematic literature review, which included 297 articles on mobile technologies applied to hearing loss, and (b) a review of mobile applications aimed at teaching and training hearing-impaired children, which included 43 applications. The review was carried out taking into account technological, pedagogical and auditory aspects. The results obtained show the scarcity of learning applications that contribute to language development in hearing-impaired children. Additionally, some aspects that could be considered in the design of new mobile applications have also been identified, such as lack of visual interfaces based on augmented reality. This study opens up a new area where researchers and developers could work together in context-based mobile learning for hearing-impaired children.";;10.1007/s10209-021-00841-z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-021-00841-z;;;Cochlear implants training, Learning of hearing-impaired children, Augmented reality, Mobile learning, Mobile applications;Springer-Verlag;1615-5289;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Enabling Software Resilience in GPGPU Applications via Partial Thread Protection;Yang, Lishan and Nie, Bin and Jog, Adwait and Smirni, Evgenia;;2021;ACM Digital Library;1248–1259;;Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are widely used by various applications in a broad variety of fields to accelerate their computation but remain susceptible to transient hardware faults (soft errors) that can easily compromise application output. By taking advantage of a general purpose GPU application hierarchical organization in threads, warps, and cooperative thread arrays, we propose a methodology that identifies the resilience of threads and aims to map threads with the same resilience characteristics to the same warp. This allows engaging partial replication mechanisms for error detection/correction at the warp level. By exploring 12 benchmarks (17 kernels) from 4 benchmark suites, we illustrate that threads can be remapped into reliable or unreliable warps with only 1.63% introduced overhead (on average), and then enable selective protection via replication to those groups of threads that truly need it. Furthermore, we show that thread remapping to different warps does not sacrifice application performance. We show how this remapping facilitates warp replication for error detection and/or correction and achieves an average reduction of 20.61% and 27.15% execution cycles, respectively comparing to standard duplication/triplication.;;10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00114;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00114;;;Transient faults, Thread remapping, Reliability, GPGPU application resilience;IEEE Press;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;XRaSE: towards virtually tangible software using augmented reality;Mehra, Rohit and Sharma, Vibhu Saujanya and Kaulgud, Vikrant and Podder, Sanjay;;2020;ACM Digital Library;1194–1197;;Software engineering has seen much progress in recent past including introduction of new methodologies, new paradigms for software teams, and from smaller monolithic applications to complex, intricate, and distributed software applications. However, the way we represent, discuss, and collaborate on software applications throughout the software development life cycle is still primarily using the source code, textual representations, or charts on 2D computer screens - the confines of which have long limited how we visualize and comprehend software systems. In this paper, we present XRaSE, a novel prototype implementation that leverages augmented reality to visualize a software application as a virtually tangible entity. This immersive approach is aimed at making activities like application comprehension, architecture analysis, knowledge communication, and analysis of a software's dynamic aspects, more intuitive, richer and collaborative.

;Scheduling Internet of Things requests to minimize latency in hybrid Fog–Cloud;Raafat O. Aburukba and Mazin AliKarrar and Taha Landolsi and Khaled El-Fakih;Future Generation Computer Systems;2020;Science@Direct;539-551;111;Delivering services for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that demand real-time and predictable latency is a challenge. Several IoT applications require stringent latency requirements due to the interaction between the IoT devices and the physical environment through sensing and actuation. The limited capabilities of IoT devices require applications to be integrated in Cloud and Fog computing paradigms. Fog computing significantly improves on the service latency as it brings resources closer to the edge. The characteristics of both Fog and Cloud computing will enable the integration and interoperation of a large number of IoT devices and services in different domains. This work models the scheduling of IoT service requests as an optimization problem using integer programming in order to minimize the overall service request latency. The scheduling problem by nature is NP-hard, and hence, exact optimization solutions are inadequate for large size problems. This work introduces a customized implementation of the genetic algorithm (GA) as a heuristic approach to schedule the IoT requests to achieve the objective of minimizing the overall latency. The GA is tested in a simulation environment that considers the dynamic nature of the environment. The performance of the GA is evaluated and compared to the performance of waited-fair queuing (WFQ), priority-strict queuing (PSQ), and round robin (RR) techniques. The results show that the overall latency for the proposed approach is 21.9% to 46.6% better than the other algorithms. The proposed approach also showed significant improvement in meeting the requests deadlines by up to 31%.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.09.039;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X18303327;;;Internet of Things, Cloud computing, Fog computing, Latency, Scheduling, Optimization, Genetic algorithm;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;ProConAR: A Tool Support for Model-Based AR Product Configuration;Gottschalk, Sebastian and Yigitbas, Enes and Schmidt, Eugen and Engels, Gregor;;2020;ACM Digital Library;207–215;;Mobile shopping apps have been using Augmented Reality (AR) in the last years to place their products in the environment of the customer. While this is possible with atomic 3D objects, there is still a lack in the runtime configuration of 3D object compositions based on user needs and environmental constraints. For this, we previously developed an approach for model-based AR-assisted product configuration based on the concept of Dynamic Software Product Lines. In this demonstration paper, we present the corresponding tool support ProConAR in the form of a Product Modeler and a Product Configurator. While the Product Modeler is an Angular web app that splits products (e.g. table) up into atomic parts (e.g. tabletop, table legs, funnier) and saves it within a configuration model, the Product Configurator is an Android client that uses the configuration model to place different product configurations within the environment of the customer. We show technical details of our ready to use tool-chain ProConAR by describing its implementation and usage as well as pointing out future research directions.;;10.1007/978-3-030-64266-2_14;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-64266-2_14;;;Tool support, Model-based, Augmented Reality, Product configuration;Springer-Verlag;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;URMILA: Dynamically trading-off fog and edge resources for performance and mobility-aware IoT services;Shashank Shekhar and Ajay Chhokra and Hongyang Sun and Aniruddha Gokhale and Abhishek Dubey and Xenofon Koutsoukos and Gabor Karsai;Journal of Systems Architecture;2020;Science@Direct;101710;107;The fog/edge computing paradigm is increasingly being adopted to support a range of latency-sensitive IoT services due to its ability to assure the latency requirements of these services while supporting the elastic properties of cloud computing. IoT services that cater to user mobility, however, face a number of challenges in this context. First, since user mobility can incur wireless connectivity issues, executing these services entirely on edge resources, such as smartphones, will result in a rapid drain in the battery charge. In contrast, executing these services entirely on fog resources, such as cloudlets or micro data centers, will incur higher communication costs and increased latencies in the face of fluctuating wireless connectivity and signal strength. Second, a high degree of multi-tenancy on fog resources involving different IoT services can lead to performance interference issues due to resource contention. In order to address these challenges, this paper describes URMILA, which makes dynamic resource management decisions to achieve effective trade-offs between using the fog and edge resources yet ensuring that the latency requirements of the IoT services are met. We evaluate URMILA’s capabilities in the context of a real-world use case on an emulated but realistic IoT testbed.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2020.101710;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762120300047;;;Fog computing, Edge computing, Cloud computing, User mobility, Latency-sensitive, IoT, Resource management, Performance interference, Latency, Offloading;;1383-7621;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Haptic interaction for needle insertion training in medical applications: The state-of-the-art;Cléber G. Corrêa and Fátima L.S. Nunes and Edith Ranzini and Ricardo Nakamura and Romero Tori;Medical Engineering & Physics;2019;Science@Direct;6-25;63;"Computer-based simulation for medical procedures training has been gaining relevance, as well the use of haptic devices for developing fine motor skills in such simulations. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the state-of-the-art in virtual needle insertion training simulation based on haptic interaction. A systematic review method was applied to gather documentation that enables a rigorous audit of the process stages and results. We established a classification system based on certain characteristics of the studies analyzed, including: main procedures and target body regions in medical applications; ways to generate haptic feedback; devices; types of environment; and user validation. In addition, the review aimed to identify challenges and trends in the field, indicating research opportunities. Results showed the predominance of Virtual Reality and commercial haptic devices in simulations. Since most studies are based on subjective tests, finding ways to objectively evaluate haptic interaction perception represents a promising research field. We also found that devices and ways to generate haptic feedback and to represent tissue and needle behavior pose limitations and challenges for computer simulation. Finally, the realism provided is a constant concern in the validation process, which brings another problem: defining and performing suitable user tests.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2018.11.002;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135045331830167X;;;Haptics, Medical applications, Needle insertion, State-of-the-art, Training;;1350-4533;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Chapter 3 - Is driverless technology ready for the challenge?;Alain L. Kornhauser and Michael L. Sena;;2024;Science@Direct;53-98;;We are proposing to remove the largest cost item for delivering demand-responsive, high-quality mobility, the cost of the driver. To do that, we need to be certain that driverless cars will be ready to take on the driving task, especially in places and times where the need is greatest, in those small-to-medium cities where incomes and car ownership are lowest and where public transport is least effective. In this chapter we trace the development of driverless vehicle systems and describe the current state of their capabilities to deliver rides. We explain who is doing what, what are the roadblocks that must be overcome before driverless cars are ready for the roads, and how safe-driving cars being manufactured today will gradually incorporate the more highly automated tasks of driverless vehicles.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-23685-3.00013-3;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443236853000133;;;Driverless vehicles, SAE Levels of Driving Automation, Remote monitoring, Backup driver, Vehicle miles travelled (VMT), ADAS, Multisensory integration, Reactive localization, Connectivity;Elsevier;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Efficient service reconfiguration with partial virtual network function migration;Dongquan Liu and Zhengyan Zhou and Dong Zhang and Kaiwei Guo and Yanni Wu and Chunming Wu;Computer Networks;2024;Science@Direct;110205;241;Network Function Virtualization (NFV) decouples network functions from dedicated hardware devices into Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). These VNFs are chained in order as a Service Function Chain (SFC) to provision flexible and efficient services. When service requests dynamically increase, the intensive workloads often lead to node overloads and further impact the Quality of Service (QoS). Existing works address this problem by migrating VNFs from overload nodes to other low-load nodes, known as VNF migration. However, when a VNF is shared by multiple SFCs, migrating the VNF will change the mapping relationships between these SFCs and the physical network (nodes and links). That may make some SFCs traverse more links and increase their propagation latency. That violates the demand of users for low-latency services. In this paper, to minimize the impact of VNF migration on SFC latency, we propose partial VNF migration. It migrates only partial VNFs within these SFCs to minimize the overall SFC latency while reducing migration costs. As such, we leverage partial VNF migration for efficient latency minimization with the formulation of an integer linear programming (ILP) model. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, we propose a dynamic latency-aware partial VNF migration algorithm to reduce node overloads and minimize SFC latency. Evaluation indicates that the proposed approach has 12.7%–21.8% lower average SFC latency and 12.5%–48.5% less migration cost than state-of-the-art VNF migration algorithms. And it demonstrates about 90% shorter execution time with similar minimization performance, compared to other SFC reconfiguration algorithms.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2024.110205;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624000379;;;Network function virtualization, Service function chain, VNF migration, Multi-access edge computing, Request dynamics;;1389-1286;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Design of personnel big data management system based on blockchain;Jian Chen and Zhihan Lv and Houbing Song;Future Generation Computer Systems;2019;Science@Direct;1122-1129;101;With the continuous development of information technology, enterprises, universities and governments are constantly stepping up the construction of electronic personnel information management system. The information of hundreds of thousands or even millions of people’s information are collected and stored into the system. So much information provides the cornerstone for the development of big data, if such data is tampered with or leaked, it will cause irreparable serious damage. However, in recent years, electronic archives have exposed a series of problems such as information leakage, information tampering, and information loss, which has made the reform of personnel information management more and more urgent. The unique characteristics of the blockchain, such as non-tampering and traceability make it have great application potential in personnel information management, and can effectively solve many problems of traditional file management. However, the blockchain is limited by its own shortcomings such as small storage space and slow synchronization time, and cannot be directly applied to the big data field. This paper proposes a personnel management system based on blockchain, we analyzed the defects of the blockchain and proposed an improved method, constructs a novel data storage model of on-chain and out-of-chain that can effectively solve the problem of data redundancy and insufficient storage space. Based on this, we developed a prototype system with query, add, modify, and track personnel information, verified the feasibility of applying blockchain to personnel information management, explore the possibility of combining blockchain with big data.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.07.037;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19313354;;;Big data, Blockchain, Information management, Data separation;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Toy user interfaces: Systematic and industrial mapping;Anna Priscilla {de Albuquerque} and Judith Kelner;Journal of Systems Architecture;2019;Science@Direct;77-106;97;Toys are play products designed for leisure and social play activities. Today, play products increasingly incorporate hardware and software computation, often connecting to online services and other computing devices, thus being commonly referred to as “smart toys.” Accordingly, such products can also be categorized as user interfaces as they allow human interaction with digital contents using the physical toys’ inputs and outputs. Here we propose the idea of Toy-User-Interfaces (ToyUI) and relate them to the domains of human-computer interaction, mixed reality, and the Internet of Things. We surveyed and categorized a multitude of ToyUIs, gathering information from research papers and toy companies by performing both a systematic mapping (covering research from 2008 to 2017) and an industrial mapping (covering releases from 2012 to 2017). The resulting 297 items were then analyzed according to our classification model, being divided into four categories, eight genres, and 22 setups, considering the play features and the interface features of such items. The classification model and the analysis of the results allowed us to identify six trends in design and technology for ToyUI. Ultimately, our research findings may guide the future of ToyUI projects for researchers, designers, educators, therapists, and end-users.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2018.12.001;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138376211830153X;;;Smart toys, Toy user interfaces, Playful interfaces, Tangible interfaces, Mixed-reality;;1383-7621;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A novel big data analytics framework for smart cities;Ahmed M. Shahat Osman;Future Generation Computer Systems;2019;Science@Direct;620-633;91;The emergence of smart cities aims at mitigating the challenges raised due to the continuous urbanization development and increasing population density in cities. To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2018.06.046;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17307446;;;Analytics framework, Apache Hadoop, Apache spark, Big data, Smart cities;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Developing a platform to evaluate and assess the security of wearable devices;Matthew L. Hale and Kerolos Lotfy and Rose F. Gamble and Charles Walter and Jessica Lin;Digital Communications and Networks;2019;Science@Direct;147-159;5;Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user, wearables serve a variety of commercial, medical and personal uses. Depending on a certain smartphone application, a wearable can capture sensitive data about the user and provide critical, possibly life-or-death, functionality. When using wearables, security problems might occur on hardware/software of wearables, connected phone apps or web services devices, or Bluetooth channels used for communication. This paper develops an open source platform called SecuWear for identifying vulnerabilities in these areas and facilitating wearable security research to mitigate them. SecuWear supports the creation, evaluation, and analysis of security vulnerability tests on actual hardwares. Extending earlier results, this paper includes an empirical evaluation that demonstrates proof of concept attacks on commercial wearable devices and shows how SecuWear captures the information necessary for identifying such attacks. Also included is a process for releasing attack and mitigation information to the security community.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcan.2018.10.009;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352864817302985;;;Bluetooth LE, Internet of things, Man-in-the-middle attacks, Security, Vulnerability discovery, Wearables;;2352-8648;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Short- and long-term cost and performance optimization for mobile user equipments;Yan Ding and Kenli Li and Chubo Liu and Zhuo Tang and Keqin Li;Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing;2021;Science@Direct;69-84;150;Task offloading strategy optimization in mobile edge computing (MEC) has always been a hot issue. However, the mobility of a user equipment (UE) seriously affects the UE’s cost and performance. This paper proposes three mobility types depending on whether the mobility characteristic of a UE is known, and formulates an energy minimization problem and a latency minimization problem to optimize the cost and performance, respectively. We first develop greedy strategy based task offloading algorithms for UEs according to their mobility characteristics. However, accurately obtaining the mobility characteristics of the UEs over a long time in practice is a huge challenge, especially in a highly random environment like the MEC. To address the issue, we use a Lyapunov optimization method to develop the algorithms that do not require any prior knowledge of the mobility characteristics to minimize the long-term energy and latency of UEs. Experimental results show that the greedy strategy based algorithms can optimize the cost and performance of UEs by using their mobility characteristics, and perform better than the Lyapunov optimization based algorithms in a short-term. However, the Lyapunov optimization based algorithms perform better than the greedy strategy based algorithms over a long-term.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.12.006;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731520304226;;;Greedy strategy, Lyapunov optimization, Mobile edge computing, Mobility characteristic, Task offloading strategy;;0743-7315;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The automobile industry is experiencing unprecedented change. Despite its century-old history based mostly in the art of mechanics, increased development of technology and heightened awareness of environmental issues has pushed traditional automobile manufacturers to completely re-examine their strategies. It has also newly invited nontraditional players such as electronic and IT tycoons namely, Samsung, Google, and Apple into the game. The advent of electric cars with cutting edge technology requires active participation and collaboration from diverse industries requiring cross-over joint ventures and M&As. In this light, the recent acquisition of Harman Incorporated for eight billion dollars by Samsung Electronics in 2016 is a significant event that signals great change. As the electronics tycoon expands its boundaries preparing to become an important player in the automobile industry, this study examines how Samsung increases and integrates its knowledge base and innovation capability through the M&A deal with Harman in attempts to enhance its competitiveness in the rapidly evolving automotive market.";;https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc5030051;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S219985312200988X;;;open innovation, M&A, automobile industry, autonomous driving, electric cars, post-merger integration;;2199-8531;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;4 - Building as a smart system;Riadh Habash;;2022;Science@Direct;95-128;;The growing calls for connectivity, capability, and agility as determinants of sustainability in the built environment entail a growing need to improve the smart infrastructure particularly in terms of the electrical grid and communication-enabled solutions. Innovation through design is making the electricity industry experiences the same sort of rapid development as the information and communication technology industry has undergone during the past 30 years. Today, electrical utilities have the opportunity of seizing the potential of advanced communication, computing, and control technologies where smart technologies are the existing hub of innovation. To realize this fact, it is essential to integrate smartness and intelligence at all levels of the built environment infrastructure. This chapter explains how utilities and consumers are enabled to pool power from multiple plants and distributed sources to achieve high flexibility and scale by taking advantage of the smart grid capabilities. By integrating energy efficiency, distributed energy generation technologies, and demand flexibility into buildings, the state of the art in grid-interactive efficient buildings can be advanced. Such integration is feasible with the deployment of smart electrical load management strategies supported by sensor and actuator wireless networks that offer potential on the path toward Tactile Internet, Internet of Energy, smart urban mobility, net-zero energy buildings, and ultimately long-term sustainability and health.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-98826-1.00004-1;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323988261000041;;;Smart grid, Virtual power plants, Demand response, Grid-interactive efficient buildings, Tactile Internet, Internet-of-Things, Internet of Energy, Wireless sensor and actuator networks, Smart mobility, Net-zero energy buildings;Woodhead Publishing;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Chapter 1 - Digital Assets as Economic Goods;Keyun Ruan;;2019;Science@Direct;1-28;;"This chapter first looks at the origins and philosophical concept of value, the different schools of thoughts from the subjective and objective views of value, the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic value, the definition of traditional assets, the definition of economic goods, and current asset valuation methods. Then, five unique characteristics of digital assets distinct from traditional assets are outlined. For example, the most fundamental assumptions of the discipline of economics are that: (1) the amount of resources available for a society is limited; and (2) the market exists as a measure of substitutability of those limited resources. To find optimal distribution of resources by means of free competition under these assumptions has always been thought to be the fundamental purpose of economics. Today, some argue “limitless” computing has arrived, making digital value theory inherently unique from past theories. This chapter then defines intrinsic digital value, extrinsic digital value, and a digital value matrix for categorizing digital assets according to their economic functions, this is, core value versus supporting value, digitized versus digital native, rather than technical functions, for example, software, hardware, etc. Attributes of digital assets that contribute to intrinsic and extrinsic value creation are then discussed along with measurement methods.

We introduce the Virtual Drone Search Game as a first step in creating a mixed reality simulation for humans to practice drone teaming and SAR techniques. Our goals are to (1) evaluate input modalities for the drones, derived from an iterative narrowing of the design space, (2) improve our mixed reality system for designing input modalities and training operators, and (3) collect data on how participants socially experience the virtual drones with which they work. In our study, 17 participants played the game with two input modalities (Gesture condition, Tap condition) in counterbalanced order. Results indicated that participants performed best with the Gesture condition. Participants found the multiple controls challenging, and future studies might include more training of the devices and game.

Aiming to narrow this gap, the objective of this study is to investigate the concept of fintech, to map the literature and point out new routes and opportunities in the field. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed, attempting to describe the areas of fintech activities, propose a categorization for this literature, highlight the main issues dealt with to date in the sample publications, as well as to point out new questions for continuing research in this field. The results show a set of definitions for the term fintech and suggest as a comprehensive understanding of fintech, as innovative companies active in the financial industry making use of the availability of communication, the ubiquity of the internet, and the automated processing of information. Moreover, the literature focuses on financial services and innovations, dealing with issues of financial industry regulation and local legislation or the financial system globally. The innovation of research subcategories (technology adoption/network externalities), blockchain and security appear with great emphasis in this work and represent the current most sensitive aspects also linked to the more global theme of digital transformation.

Digital twin and related information technologies are widely used in the construction, operation and maintenance of infrastructure and facility. Transdisciplinary stakeholders are always involved in the long-term and cross-scene management of IoT and digital twin-enabled smart infrastructures and facilities. The intensive interactions among stakeholders often cause conflicts due to the variations in experience, knowledge, and interests. Moreover, with the change propagation of digital twins, cyber-physical resources can’t be efficiently and consistently established, connected, and utilized with multi-domain information through selective simplification and structured methods.

To mitigate service delay and enhance Quality of Service (QoS), we introduce a hybrid optimization of Particle Swarm (PSO) and Chemical Reaction (CRO) to improve service delay in FogPlan, an offline framework that prioritizes QoS and enables dynamic fog service deployment. The method optimizes fog service allocation based on incoming traffic to each fog node, formulating it as an Integer Non-Linear Programming (INLP) problem, considering various service attributes and costs. Our proposed algorithm aims to minimize service delay and QoS degradation.

;Internet of things in medicine: A systematic mapping study;Farahnaz Sadoughi and Ali Behmanesh and Nasrin Sayfouri;Journal of Biomedical Informatics;2020;Science@Direct;103383;103;"Context
The current studies on IoT in healthcare have reviewed the uses of this technology in a combination of healthcare domains, including nursing, rehabilitation sciences, ambient assisted living (AAL), medicine, etc. However, no review study has scrutinized IoT advances exclusively in medicine irrespective of other healthcare domains.
Objectives
The purpose of the current study was to identify and map the current IoT developments in medicine through providing graphical/tabular classifications on the current experimental and practical IoT information in medicine, the involved medical sub-fields, the locations of IoT use in medicine, and the bibliometric information about IoT research articles.
Methods
In this systematic mapping study, the studies published between 2000 and 2018 in major online scientific databases, including IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were screened. A total of 3679 papers were found from which 89 papers were finally selected based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Results
While the majority of medical IoT studies were experimental and prototyping in nature, they generally reported that home was the most popular place for medical IoT applications. It was also found that neurology, cardiology, and psychiatry/psychology were the medical sub-fields receiving the most IoT attention. Bibliometric analysis showed that IEEE Internet of Things Journal has published the most influential IoT articles. India, China and the United States were found to be the most involved countries in medical IoT research.
Conclusions
Although IoT has not yet been employed in some medical sub-fields, recent substantial surge in the number of medical IoT studies will most likely lead to the engagement of more medical sub-fields in the years to come.

;Security and Energy-aware Collaborative Task Offloading in D2D communication;Zhongjin Li and Haiyang Hu and Hua Hu and Binbin Huang and Jidong Ge and Victor Chang;Future Generation Computer Systems;2021;Science@Direct;358-373;118;Device-to-device (D2D) communication technique is used to establish direct links among mobile devices (MDs) to reduce communication delay and increase network capacity over the underlying wireless networks. Existing D2D schemes for task offloading focus on system throughput, energy consumption, and delay without considering data security. This paper proposes a Security and Energy-aware Collaborative Task Offloading for D2D communication (Sec2D). Specifically, we first build a novel security model, in terms of the number of CPU cores, CPU frequency, and data size, for measuring the security workload on heterogeneous MDs. Then, we formulate the collaborative task offloading problem that minimizes the time-average delay and energy consumption of MDs while ensuring data security. In order to meet this goal, the Lyapunov optimization framework is applied to implement online decision-making. Two solutions, greedy approach and optimal approach, with different time complexities, are proposed to deal with the generated mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The theoretical proofs demonstrate that Sec2D follows a [O(1∕V),O(V)] energy-delay tradeoff. Simulation results show that Sec2D can guarantee both data security and system stability in the collaborative D2D communication environment.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2021.01.021;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X21000315;;;D2D communication, Security modeling, Collaborative task offloading, Lyapunov optimization, Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP);;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Kang and Raphael Sznitman and Koorosh Faridpooya and Iulian Iordachita;;2020;Science@Direct;627-672;;Retinal surgery has long drawn the attention of engineers and clinicians who identified a clear use case for robotics and assistive technology. In retinal surgery, precision is paramount. Skilled practitioners operate on the boundaries of human capability, dealing with minuscule anatomic structures that are both fragile and hard to discern. Surgical operations on the retina, a hair-thick multilayered structure that is an integral part of the central nervous system responsible for vision, spurred the development of robotic systems that enhance perception, precision, and dexterity. This chapter provides an encompassing overview of the progress that has been made during the last two decades in terms of sensing, modeling, visualization, stabilization, and control. The chapter reports on recent breakthroughs with first-in-human experiences, as well as on new venues that hold the potential to expand retinal surgery to techniques that would be infeasible or challenging without robotics.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-814245-5.00036-0;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128142455000360;;;Robotics, retinal surgery, vitreoretinal surgery, eye surgery, microsurgery, sensing, augmented reality, modeling and control;Elsevier;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Internet of Things: Evolution and technologies from a security perspective;Ruth Ande and Bamidele Adebisi and Mohammad Hammoudeh and Jibran Saleem;Sustainable Cities and Society;2020;Science@Direct;101728;54;"In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of life including smart homes, smart cities, agriculture, offices, and workplaces. Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced.

In this paper, we present CamTest, a novel laboratory testbed for camera-based mobile sensing applications. It enables researchers to conduct systematic, affordable and efficient tests on their applications in laboratory conditions. Instead of real-world tests that directly use the camera, CamTest delivers the frames of a video clip to the image processing module of the targeted application. Meanwhile, CamTest tracks the image processing output, errors and image processing speed of the targeted application at runtime. After testing, CamTest can visualise the recorded information simultaneously with video playback so that testers can understand how the sensing context affects the behaviours of the application. Through computational efficiency measurements, and a user study with 14 developers, we show that CamTest can effectively facilitate and simplify the testing of camera-based mobile sensing applications.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmcj.2019.04.001;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574119218303675;;;Mobile devices, Smartphones, Software testing, Multimedia;;1574-1192;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The frontiers of these computing technologies have been boosted by shift from manually encoded algorithms to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven autonomous systems for optimum and reliable management of distributed computing resources. Prior work focuses on improving existing systems using AI across a wide range of domains, such as efficient resource provisioning, application deployment, task placement, and service management. This survey reviews the evolution of data-driven AI-augmented technologies and their impact on computing systems. We demystify new techniques and draw key insights in Edge, Fog and Cloud resource management-related uses of AI methods and also look at how AI can innovate traditional applications for enhanced Quality of Service (QoS) in the presence of a continuum of resources. We present the latest trends and impact areas such as optimizing AI models that are deployed on or for computing systems. We layout a roadmap for future research directions in areas such as resource management for QoS optimization and service reliability.

This study reviews ontology research mainly published in the Scopus database from 2007 to 2017 with the combination of scientometric analysis and critical review. Scientometric analysis (e.g. co-author, co-word, co-citation, and clusters) objectively visualized the research status quo while a critical review was used to identify the research themes and challenges of ontology research in the construction industry. The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were “project management” at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from “project management”, and “knowledge management” to “building information modeling”, and “compliance control” with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry. Four research themes were identified with the combination of cluster analysis and critical review: “Domain ontology”, “Industry foundation classes”, “Automated compliance checking”, and “Building information modeling”. This review provides an in-depth understanding of existing ontology research and indicates the emerging trends in this research domain.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2018.12.013;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580518305648;;;Ontology, Research trends, Scientometrics, CiteSpace, Construction industry;;0926-5805;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Point attention network for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds;Mingtao Feng and Liang Zhang and Xuefei Lin and Syed Zulqarnain Gilani and Ajmal Mian;Pattern Recognition;2020;Science@Direct;107446;107;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have performed extremely well on data represented by regularly arranged grids such as images. However, directly leveraging the classic convolution kernels or parameter sharing mechanisms on sparse 3D point clouds is inefficient due to their irregular and unordered nature. We propose a point attention network that learns rich local shape features and their contextual correlations for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. Since the geometric distribution of the neighboring points is invariant to the point ordering, we propose a Local Attention-Edge Convolution (LAE-Conv) to construct a local graph based on the neighborhood points searched in multi-directions. We assign attention coefficients to each edge and then aggregate the point features as a weighted sum of its neighbors. The learned LAE-Conv layer features are then given to a point-wise spatial attention module to generate an interdependency matrix of all points regardless of their distances, which captures long-range spatial contextual features contributing to more precise semantic information. The proposed point attention network consists of an encoder and decoder which, together with the LAE-Conv layers and the point-wise spatial attention modules, make it an end-to-end trainable network for predicting dense labels for 3D point cloud segmentation. Experiments on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds show that our algorithm can perform at par or better than the existing state of the art methods.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107446;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320320302491;;;Semantic segmentation, 3D point cloud, Point attention network, Deep learning;;0031-3203;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Vachtsevanou and Ioanna Kontou;Annual Reviews in Control;2019;Science@Direct;237-248;47;Today's customers are characterized by individual requirements that lead the manufacturing industry to increased product variety and volume reduction. Manufacturing systems and more specifically assembly systems (ASs) should allow quick adaptation of manufacturing assets so as to respond to the evolving market requirements that lead to mass customization. Meanwhile, the manufacturing era is changing due to the fourth industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 4.0, that will change the traditional manufacturing environment to an IoT-based one. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of cyber-physical microservice in the Manufacturing and the ASs domain and presents the Cyber-Physical microservice and IoT-based (CPuS-IoT) framework. The CPuS-IoT framework exploits the benefits of the microservice architectural style and the IoT technologies, but also utilizes the existing in this domain huge investment based on traditional technologies, to support the life cycle of evolvable ASs in the age of Industry 4.0. It provides a solid basis to capture domain knowledge that is used by a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to semi-automate the development, evolution and operation of ASs, as well as, to establish a common vocabulary for assembly system experts and IoT ones. The CPuS-IoT approach and framework effectively combines MDE with IoT and the microservice architectural paradigm. A case study for the assembly of an everyday life product is adopted to demonstrate the approach even to non-experts of this domain.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2019.03.005;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578818301275;;;Manufacturing system architecture, Cyber-physical systems, Assembly systems, Industry 4.0, Microservices, IoT;;1367-5788;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Lee and Christoph Herrmann and Sebastian Thiede;CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology;2020;Science@Direct;351-369;31;In the context of the fourth industrial revolution, an increasing number of advances in manufacturing result from smart integration of information technology (IT) and data-driven solutions in factories. An essential limiting factor for improvements is the capability of the IT system. In addition to the IT hardware specifications, the choice of an appropriate IT architecture (Cloud, Fog, or Edge Computing driven) determines the overall investment, environmental impact, and resulting net benefit. This article presents a comprehensive systematic approach that seeks to support the choice of an appropriate IT infrastructure. It is deliberately aimed at supporting especially non-IT experts, guiding the practitioner through a multi-phase process. The approach is applied to an exemplary use case in the field of industrial technical building equipment, but can also be applied to any application case involving the planning of the IT infrastructure in a manufacturing context.

In an intelligent factory, introducing edge computing is conducive to expanding the computing resources, the network bandwidth, and the storage capacity of the cloud platform to the IoT edge, as well as realizing the resource scheduling and data uplink and downlink processing during the manufacturing and production processes. Moreover, the emotion recognition and interaction of the Affective Interaction Intelligence Robot (iRobot), with the IoT cloud platform as the infrastructure and AI technology as the core competitiveness, can better solve the psychological problems of the user. Accordingly, this has become a hot research topic in the field of intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, we describe an intelligent robot factory (iRobot-Factory), adopt a highly interconnected and deeply integrated intelligent production line, and introduce the overall structure, composition, characteristics, and advantages of such a factory in details from the two aspects of cognitive manufacturing and edge computing. Then, we describe the implementation of the volume production of iRobot using iRobot-Factory and look at the system performance experimental results and analysis of the iRobot-Factory and a traditional factory. The experimental results show that our scheme significantly improved both the chip assembly and the production efficiency, while the number of system instructions also decreased significantly.

Existing literature suggests that industry-specific studies need to be conducted. The work presented in this study shows a preliminary cybersecurity threat model relevant to the AEC industry. To that end, threat models for each of the life cycle phases are proposed. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated with an example from the commissioning phase of a building, which includes an autonomous robotic system to collect data as a possible countermeasure. The suggested countermeasure shows promise to address some of the cybersecurity challenges faced in the building certification and commissioning process. The results show that the likelihood of detecting rogue sensors increases with additional constraints in the monitoring robot, such as minimum and maximum distance.

The model provides an early stage applied research view of (groups of) “game changing” variables, which accelerate diffusion of innovations to significantly reduce financial uncertainty and minimize the time to derive value from the original idea. The model is applied to multiple case studies related to the repurposing and customization of existing mass manufacturing infrastructures and processes to meet novel requirements. Case studies include among others a reference model based on a literature review, the diffusion of 3-D printing technology in manufacturing, the diffusion of novel cement manufacturing technology and the manufacturing of intensive care ventilators during the Covid-19 pandemic. The diffusion of innovation model applied is based on diffusion of innovation principles founded in the research of Everett Rodgers, the Bass Diffusion Curve and aligned to recent advances in living (eco-) systems theory. Special emphasis is placed on determining not only the relevance of “known-known” success factors for rapid innovation diffusion, but also on identifying “unknown-unknown” game changers enabling the required changes at pace. Key findings are that “game changing” factors for the innovations are primarily the interdependent availability of budget and resources to achieve market saturation, urgency of need shared by all participants, observability of impact (value creation) and compatibility with existing ways of work. Critical as well is population of all diffusion web roles with unique individuals. Further research is suggested regarding the dependency of assessed variable (groups) and the integration of Technical Readiness Level phases into the forecasting model.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2021.01.074;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827121001013;;;High Value Manufacturing, Diffusion of Innovation, Maturity Model, Living Systems, Innovation Acceleration, Game Changers;;2212-8271;;8th CIRP Global Web Conference – Flexible Mass Customisation (CIRPe 2020);"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Nevertheless, such solutions are not as significantly implemented as expected by the CIRP keynote in 2010: it is not a dominant business of manufacturing companies today despite their economic and environmental advantages. One reason for this delay is assumed to be that the initial efforts were mainly on business and service when design was an afterthought. The promising digital technologies that have become easily implementable in practice will in the next years facilitate design and implementation of IPS² smartly to satisfy users and contribute to sustainability. This keynote analyses literature and practice in the last decade, aiming to propose the main characteristics of IPS² of the future and design processes adequate for IPS². The design process of both production systems for sustainability and high-value systems for sustainable development goals may need to be supported differently than today.

Those edge servers are deployed at base stations to provide nearby users with high-quality services. Thus, data caching is extremely important in ensuring low latency for service delivery in the edge computing environment. To minimize the data caching cost and maximize the reduction in service latency, we formulate this Edge Data Caching (EDC) problem as a constrained optimization problem in this paper. We prove the NP-completeness of this EDC problem and provide an optimal solution named IPEDC to solve this problem based on Integer Programming. Then, we propose an approximation algorithm named AEDC to find approximate solutions with a limited bound. We conduct intensive experiments on a real-world data set and a synthesized data set to evaluate our approaches. Our results demonstrate that IPEDC and AEDC significantly outperform the four representative baseline approaches.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.07.016;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19330973;;;Optimization, Edge computing, Edge data caching;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Unifying Digital Twin Framework: Simulation-Based Proof-of-Concept;Mamadou K. Traoré;IFAC-PapersOnLine;2021;Science@Direct;886-893;54;In recent years, the Digital Twin (DT) concept has surfaced in many areas and landed the approach in top strategic technology trends. However, there seems to be no unique understanding of the concept, and debates about what is a DT are leading to ambiguity on the concrete solution to be developed in a given situation. This paper introduces a unifying reference framework, to both serve as a conceptual basis that disambiguates the concept and a guide to derive custom solutions.

The connection with the physical world, which is inherent to CPS, brings the need to operate and respond in real-time. As the cloud becomes part of the computation loop, the real-time requirements have to be also reflected by the cloud. In this paper, we present an approach that provides soft real-time guarantees on the response time of services running in cloud and edge–cloud (i.e., cloud geographically close to the end-user), where these services are developed in high-level programming languages. In particular, we elaborate a method that allows us to predict the upper bound of the response time of a service when sharing the same computer with other services. Importantly, as our approach focuses on minimizing the impact on the developer of such services, it does not require any special programming model nor limits usage of common libraries, etc.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.110872;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121220302624;;;Cyber–physical systems, edge–cloud, Guaranteed latency;;0164-1212;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Offloading decision methods for multiple users with structured tasks in edge computing for smart cities;Li Kuang and Tao Gong and Shuyin OuYang and Honghao Gao and Shuiguang Deng;Future Generation Computer Systems;2020;Science@Direct;717-729;105;"An edge computing system is an emergent architecture for providing computing, storage, control, and networking abilities, that is an important technology to realize Internet of Things and smart cities. In an edge computing environment, users can offload their computationally expensive tasks to offloading points, which may reduce the energy consumption or communication delay. There are a large number of offloading points and users in a system, and their tasks are structured. However, resources of offloading points are limited, and users have different preferences for energy consumption and communication delays. In this paper, we first establish a system model for the environment with multiple users, multiple offloading points, and structured tasks. Then, we formalize an offloading decision problem in such an environment as a cost-minimization problem, which is a NP-hard problem. Thus, we design a method based on backtracking to obtain its exact solution; the method’s time complexity is, unfortunately, exponential with the number of offloading points. To reduce the complexity, a method based on an improved genetic algorithm and a method based on a greedy strategy are designed. Finally, we validate and compare three methods in terms of the total cost of all users, resource utilization of offloading points and execution time. The simulation results show that the last method performs the best.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.12.039;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19323325;;;Edge computing, Internet of things, Smart city, Offloading decision, Minimization;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Session persistence for dynamic web applications in Named Data Networking;Xiuquan Qiao and Pei Ren and Junliang Chen and Wei Tan and M. Brian Blake and Wangli Xu;Journal of Network and Computer Applications;2019;Science@Direct;220-235;125;Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising future network architecture. It greatly facilitates static Web content distribution due to its information-centric communication paradigm, novel in-network caching, and name-based routing features. However, NDN still lacks efficient support for dynamic Web applications. Specifically, the inefficient communications are attributed to inherent features of NDN, such as its being multisource and multicast, as well as its decoupling of content from location. A dynamic Web request generally includes dozens of Interest packets. Since NDN lacks efficient support for the session persistence of dynamic Web applications, existing name-based forwarding strategies cannot effectively forward those Interest packets that belong to the same session to the specific server in cases where multiple server clusters are deployed by the Application Service Provider (ASP). This, therefore, leads to the packet retransmission problem: retransmitted Interest packets waste network resources and degrade the performance of dynamic Web applications. How to effectively maintain session persistence is worth considering for an NDN network. To this end, we design and implement a system framework that aims to enhance dynamic Web applications over NDN through a session-oriented approach. First, we propose a session-based forwarding model that maintains a virtual connection during an online interaction. Second, we design a robust forwarding scheme that can balance the dynamic content traffic with a fault recovery capability. Finally, we implement our approach and conduct experiments on the ndnSIM, network topology in the simulation is designed based on the China Education and Research Network 2. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves network utilization and reduces the service delay, i.e., 90.36%, 50.23% utilization improvement and 84.83%, 45.68% service delay reduction, respectively, compared with two existing approaches.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2018.10.015;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804518303370;;;Dynamic Web application, Session persistence, Forwarding, Named Data Networking, Information-centric networking, Future internet;;1084-8045;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Deploying OWL ontologies for semantic mediation of mixed-reality interactions for human–robot collaborative assembly;Joe David and Eric Coatanéa and Andrei Lobov;Journal of Manufacturing Systems;2023;Science@Direct;359-381;70;For effective human–robot collaborative assembly, it is paramount to view both robots and humans as autonomous entities in that they can communicate, undertake different roles, and not be bound to pre-planned routines and task sequences. However, with very few exceptions, most of recent research assumes static pre-defined roles during collaboration with centralised architectures devoid of runtime communication that can influence task responsibility and execution. Furthermore, from an information system standpoint, they lack the self-organisation needed to cope with today’s manufacturing landscape that is characterised by product variants. Therefore, this study presents collaborative agents for manufacturing ontology (CAMO), which is an information model based on description logic that maintains a self-organising team network between collaborating human–robot multi-agent system (MAS). CAMO is implemented using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). It models popular notions of net systems and represents the agent, manufacturing, and interaction contexts that accommodate generalisability to different assemblies and agent capabilities. As a novel element, a dynamic consensus-driven collaboration based on parametric validation of semantic representations of agent capabilities via runtime dynamic communication is presented. CAMO is instantiated as agent beliefs in a framework that benefits from real-time dynamic communication with the assembly design environment and incorporates a mixed-reality environment for use by the operator. The employment of web technologies to project scalable notions of intentions via mixed reality is discussed for its novelty from a technology standpoint and as an intention projection mechanism. A case study with a real diesel engine assembly provides appreciable results and demonstrates the feasibility of CAMO and the framework.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2023.07.013;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612523001450;;;Human–robot collaboration, Mixed reality, Multi-agent systems, OWL ontology, SHACL, Belief–desire–intent, Digital thread;;0278-6125;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Monocular depth estimation is an effective method for predicting depth from RGB images. First, we propose a multiscale classification network that transforms the predicted depth values into a nonlinear combination problem between multiple depth interval values. Based on the correlation of the depth information, a depth classification network was used to determine the results of the weight values of each interval. Second, the depth maps predicted by feature maps with different resolutions contain different critical information. The lower-resolution depth maps play an overall role in predicting the overall contour; the higher-resolution depth map is more accurate in predicting object edge details.

The use of both technologies in transportation systems has seen a tremendous growth that resulted in transformation of the transportation industry. Various modes of transportation, such as new transit systems, metro rails, high-speed rails, connected and automated vehicles, autonomous trains, and other emerging transportation modes (hyperloop, e-scooters, hoverboards), still face many challenges, including but not limited to economic issues, energy efficiency, social adoption, data privacy, lack of regulatory standards, reliability, security, and ethical issues.

;Edge intelligence in motion: Mobility-aware dynamic DNN inference service migration with downtime in mobile edge computing;Pu Wang and Tao Ouyang and Guocheng Liao and Jie Gong and Shuai Yu and Xu Chen;Journal of Systems Architecture;2022;Science@Direct;102664;130;Edge intelligence (EI) becomes a trend to push the deep learning frontiers to the network edge, so that deep neural networks (DNNs) applications can be well leveraged at resource-constrained mobile devices with benefits of edge computing. Due to the high user mobility among scattered edge servers in many scenarios such as internet of vehicular applications, dynamic service migration is desired to maintain a reliable and efficient quality of service (QoS). However, inevitable service downtime incurred by service migration would largely degrade the real-time performance of delay-sensitive DNN inference services. To address this issue, we advocate a user-centric management for dynamic DNN inference service migration with flexible multi-exit mechanism, aiming at maximizing overall user utility (e.g., DNN model inference accuracy) with various service downtime. We first leverage dynamic programming to propose an optimal offline migration and exit point selection strategy (OMEPS) algorithm when complete future information of user behaviors is available. Amenable to a more practical application domain without complete future information, we incorporate the OMEPS algorithm into a model predictive control (MPC) framework, then construct a mobility-aware service migration and DNN exit point selection (MOMEPS) algorithm, which improves the long-term user utility within limited predictive future information. However, heavy computation overheads of MOMEPS algorithm impose burdens on mobile devices, thus we further advocate a cost-efficient algorithm, named smart-MOMEPS, which introduces a smart migration judgement based on Neural Networks to control the implementation of (MOMEPS) algorithm by wisely estimating whether the DNN service should be migrated or not. Extensive trace-driven simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our smart-MOMEPS algorithm for achieving significant overall utility improvements with low computation overheads compared with other online algorithms.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2022.102664;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762122001771;;;DNN service migration, Multi-exit DNN, Service downtime, Mobile edge computing, Model predictive control;;1383-7621;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;DRM-SLAM: Towards dense reconstruction of monocular SLAM with scene depth fusion;Xinchen Ye and Xiang Ji and Baoli Sun and Shenglun Chen and Zhihui Wang and Haojie Li;Neurocomputing;2020;Science@Direct;76-91;396;Monocular visual SLAM methods can accurately track the camera pose and infer the scene structure by building sparse correspondence between two/multiple views of the scene. However, the reconstructed 3D maps of these methods are extremely sparse. On the other hand, deep learning is widely used to predict dense depth maps from single-view color images, but the results are subject to blurry depth boundaries, which severely deform the structure of 3D scene. Therefore, this paper proposes a dense reconstruction method under the monocular SLAM framework (DRM-SLAM), in which a novel scene depth fusion scheme is designed to fully utilize both the sparse depth samples from monocular SLAM and predicted dense depth maps from convolutional neural network (CNN). In the scheme, a CNN architecture is carefully designed for robust depth estimation. Besides, our approach also accounts for the problem of scale ambiguity existing in the monocular SLAM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and our captured dataset demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed DRM-SLAM. The evaluation of runtime and adaptability under challenging environments also verify the practicability of our method.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.02.044;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231220302344;;;Depth fusion, SLAM, Monocular, Depth estimation;;0925-2312;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

In order to solve this problem, opportunity communication is regarded as a potential solution. It can use unlicensed bands to forward content to users under delay-tolerance constraints, as well as reduce cellular data traffic. Since opportunity communication is easily interrupted when User Equipment (UE) is moving, we adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict the location of the mobile UE. Then, the meta-heuristic algorithm is used to allocate multiple contents. In addition, deep learning-based methods almost need a lot of training time.

Shamim Hossain;Ad Hoc Networks;2023;Science@Direct;103263;150;The metaverse, as an impressive technology, can achieve outstanding performance in many fields. With the development of deep neural networks (DNNs), more and more metaverse artificial intelligence (AI) applications are emerging, which have low tolerance for delay. The edge computing based metaverse AI can overcome this problem. However, these AI applications bring new challenges of high reliability, especially DNNs are subject to the security risk of adversarial attacks that generate small and imperceptible noise and cause classifier to make predictions with a high error probability. To meet the reliability requirements of AI applications, in this paper, we propose a security mechanism against adversarial attacks in edge computing based metaverse AI applications. This mechanism utilizes a modified ResNet model that defends against adversarial attacks. We deploy it on the edge cloud to preprocess the data uploaded by metaverse AI applications. In order to achieve a better model performance, we use multiple residual network blocks to build this neural network model on the basis of autoencoder. To assist the model to produce defensively high-quality images, we utilize several convolution layers with various step sizes to process multi-scale images and design to use multiple types of samples with different properties together for the model training.

;Datasets are not enough: Challenges in labeling network traffic;Jorge Luis Guerra and Carlos Catania and Eduardo Veas;Computers & Security;2022;Science@Direct;102810;120;In contrast to previous surveys, the present work is not focused on reviewing the datasets used in the network security field. The fact is that many of the available public labeled datasets represent the network behavior just for a particular time period. Given the rate of change in malicious behavior and the serious challenge to label, and maintain these datasets, they become quickly obsolete. Therefore, this work is focused on the analysis of current labeling methodologies applied to network-based data. In the field of network security, the process of labeling a representative network traffic dataset is particularly challenging and costly since very specialized knowledge is required to classify network traces. Consequently, most of the current traffic labeling methods are based on the automatic generation of synthetic network traces, which hides many of the essential aspects necessary for a correct differentiation between normal and malicious behavior. Alternatively, a few other methods incorporate non-experts users in the labeling process of real traffic with the help of visual and statistical tools. However, after conducting an in-depth analysis, it seems that all current methods for labeling suffer from fundamental drawbacks regarding the quality, volume, and speed of the resulting dataset. This lack of consistent methods for continuously generating a representative dataset with an accurate and validated methodology must be addressed by the network security research community. Moreover, a consistent label methodology is a fundamental condition for helping in the acceptance of novel detection approaches based on statistical and machine learning techniques.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2022.102810;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404822002048;;;Network security, Automatic labeling, Assisted labeling, Datasets, Network traffic;;0167-4048;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Sustainable Enterprise Design 4.0: Addressing Industry 4.0 Technologies from the Perspective of Sustainability;David S. Cochran and Erwin Rauch;Procedia Manufacturing;2020;Science@Direct;1237-1244;51;The introduction of Industry 4.0 and sustainability in production is currently on everyone’s mind. However, companies face difficulties to address these trends in their long-term enterprise strategy and design. Industry 4.0 promises strategic advantages for companies in many respects, but there is a lack of instruments and concepts for integrating emerging technologies in an overall enterprise system design. Similarly, the multiple perspectives regarding economic, environmental and social sustainability provide a framework for thinking about a strategy for sustainable enterprise design. Based on the three principles presented in this paper for Sustainable Enterprise Design, this article aims to present an approach to better address sustainability as well as Industry 4.0 in terms of a long-term strategic, enterprise design that is sustainable. As a result, a list of needs, functional requirements as well as possible Industry 4.0 physical solutions is proposed to achieve a long-term sustainable enterprise design. The consequence of the perspective of an enterprise as a system that can be designed provides a rigorous approach that takes advantage of Industry 4.0 technologies and the multiple perspectives and candidate physical solutions that the research community offers.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.10.173;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920320308;;;Industry 4.0, sustainability, triple bottom line, sustainable enterprise design, industrial revolution;;2351-9789;;30th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing (FAIM2021);"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;PLC orchestration automation to enhance human–machine integration in adaptive manufacturing systems;Fan Mo and Miriam {Ugarte Querejeta} and Joseph Hellewell and Hamood Ur Rehman and Miren {Illarramendi Rezabal} and Jack C. Chaplin and David Sanderson and Svetan Ratchev;Journal of Manufacturing Systems;2023;Science@Direct;172-187;71;Current approaches to manufacturing must evolve to respond to increasing demands for short product life cycles and customised products. Adaptive manufacturing systems integrate advanced technologies, automation, and data-driven methodologies to develop adaptable, efficient, and responsive production processes. Central to this concept is the emphasis on human involvement and fostering synergy between human operators and the manufacturing system. Significant changes to the system’s controller are required to achieve adaptivity, with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) being a common controller type. After the necessary changes to the configuration of the manufacturing system, the PLC should be reconfigured to orchestrate the new required behaviour. Automated reconfiguration is vital to rapidly responding to change, but some changes cannot be entirely achieved without human input in collaboration with automated methods. Conventional practices in PLC programming include manual, repetitive coding practices subject to errors. As a result, to ensure operational safety, the changes must be tested before being deployed to operations, ensuring it is error-free. This paper presents a methodology to automatically reconfigure the simulation environment and controller in response to a new product request. We automate the PLC code generation and testing practices to support and free up the operators when performing repetitive manufacturing reconfiguration tasks. The methodology is based on human learning, software automation, customised program development, knowledge graphs, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The presented solution is a generic, vendor-agnostic, and interoperable solution that facilitates information exchange among multiple heterogeneous environments. Lastly, we have validated the methodology as a proof of concept at an adaptive assembly cell at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2023.07.015;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612523001474;;;PLC, Automatic program generation, Structural testing, Adaptive manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0, Knowledge graph, Graph neural network;;0278-6125;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Potential effectiveness and efficiency issues in usability evaluation within digital health: A systematic literature review;Bilal Maqbool and Sebastian Herold;Journal of Systems and Software;2024;Science@Direct;111881;208;"Context:
Digital Health (DH) is widely considered essential for sustainable future healthcare systems. Software quality, particularly usability, is crucial for the success and adoption of most DH products. However, concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of usability evaluation of DH products have been raised.
Objective:
This article aims to analyse the prevalence and application contexts of usability evaluation methods in DH and to highlight potential issues related to their effectiveness and efficiency.
Method:
A systematic literature review of usability evaluation studies, published by (academic) practitioners between 2016 and April 2023, was conducted. 610 primary articles were identified and analysed, utilising five major scientific databases.
Results:
Our findings show a preference for inquiry (85%) and testing (63%) methods, with inspection used less frequently (17%). The published studies employed methods like questionnaires (75%); notably the SUS (49%), semi-structured interviews (25%), and heuristic evaluations (73%), with percentages based on their group. Data collection mainly involved the use of participant feedback (45%), audio/video recordings (44%), and system logs (20%), with both qualitative and quantitative data analyses prevalent in studies. However, several usability characteristics such as accessibility, memorability, and operability were found to be largely overlooked, and automation tools or platforms were not widely used. Among the systems evaluated were mHealth applications (70%), telehealth platforms (36%), health information technology (HIT) solutions (29%), personalized medicine (Per. Med.) (17%), wearable devices (12%), and digital therapeutics (DTx) interventions (6%), with the participation of general users, patients, healthcare providers, and informal caregivers varying based on the health condition studied. Furthermore, insights and experiences gathered from 24 articles underscored the importance of a mixed-method approach in usability evaluations, the limitations of traditional methods, the necessity for sector-specific customisation, and the potential benefits of remote usability studies. Moreover, while eye-tracking emerged as a promising evaluation technique, careful execution and interpretation are crucial to avoid data misinterpretation.
Conclusion:
The study’s findings showed that employing a combination of inquiry and testing-based methods is prevalent for evaluating DH platforms. Despite an array of DH systems, method distribution remained consistent across platforms and targeted user groups. The study also underlines the importance of involving target user groups in the process. Potentially affected cognitive abilities of participants and potential user groups of interest have to be taken into account when choosing evaluation methods, and methods might therefore need to be tailored. Complementary inspection methods might be particularly useful when recruiting representative participants is difficult. Several potential paths for future research are outlined, such as exploring novel technologies like artificial intelligence, for improved automation tool support in the usability evaluation process.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2023.111881;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121223002765;;;Software quality, Usability evaluation method, Digital healthcare (DH), eHealth, Systematic literature review (SLR);;0164-1212;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;An integrated outlook of Cyber–Physical Systems for Industry 4.0: Topical practices, architecture, and applications;Mohd Javaid and Abid Haleem and Ravi Pratap Singh and Rajiv Suman;Green Technologies and Sustainability;2023;Science@Direct;100001;1;Industry 4.0 requires a strong understanding of Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS). An Industry 4.0-enabled manufacturing environment that offers real-time data gathering, transparency and analysis across all parts of a manufacturing process is known as cyber–physical systems, also known as cyber manufacturing. Data analytics enables executives to make data-driven choices and boost productivity, while automation speeds up manufacturing and decreases machine downtime. The main objective of deploying Industry 4.0 solutions is to enable manufacturing organisations to increase collaboration by making the correct information accessible to the right people in real time. The aim of encouraging optimal decision-making at the appropriate moment is to improve efficiency and production further. The critical terms in Industry 4.0, such as the CPS, Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Twin, are widely used interchangeably in conversations about smart manufacturing. These are essential to Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing because they give users access to real-time operating data of the equipment they represent. Cyber components and physical components make up the two elements of CPS. The main aim of this paper is to brief CPS and its need for Industry 4.0. Embedded Processes and Smart 5C diagrammatically elaborate architecture of CPS for Industry 4.0. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses significant applications of CPS in Industry 4.0. For this paper, we identified and then studied relevant literature on CPS for establishing an Industry 4.0 environment. CPS is integrated into several items, including vehicles and other equipment, to carry out particular functions. CPS can be utilised in any industry, including engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and even health care, because they are all easy to use. CPS network collaborative systems are built for communication. Furthermore, cutting-edge network technologies like cloud solutions are used by CPS.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.grets.2022.100001;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S294973612200001X;;;Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS), Industry 4.0, Applications, Manufacturing;;2949-7361;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Towards Multimodal Information Systems for Assisting Humans in Production and Logistics Processes;Axel Börold and Dirk Schweers and Michael Freitag;Procedia CIRP;2023;Science@Direct;1089-1094;120;Information support systems for coping with and mastering increasing process complexity are becoming a success factor for many companies. The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements. Based on the findings, a concept for an stationary adaptive multimodal information system was developed, which, to our knowledge, does not exist yet due to the combination of a 2D/3D scanner and conversational intelligence and can be used to improve human-machine interaction in the context of Industry 5.0.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.09.130;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827123008624;;;Keywords, Industry 5.0, Information Systems, Cognitive Assistance, Human Computer Interface;;2212-8271;;56th CIRP International Conference on Manufacturing Systems 2023;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This can potentially reshape the interdependencies and interactions of complex systems, leading to our research question: To what extent and in which direction is the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and System Dynamics (SD) converging within the business and management landscape? We conducted an extensive literature review using bibliometric and topic modeling methods to address this question. Through a bibliometric analysis, we identified the areas in which academic papers referred to both SD and AI literature. However, bibliometrics do not show a clear path towards convergence. The top modeling analysis highlights more details on how convergence is structured, providing insights into how SD and AI may be integrated. Two trajectories are identified. In the “soft convergence,” AI supports system dynamics analysis and modeling more deeply characterized by social interaction. In the “hard convergence,” AI shapes innovative ways of rethinking system design, dynamics, and interdependencies. Our analysis suggests that while soft convergence is more visible in the business and management landscape, hard convergence may well represent a new frontier in studying system dynamics with the potential to reshape the landscape.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123131;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523008168;;;System dynamics, Artificial intelligence, Bibliometrics, Topic modeling, Technology, Forecasting;;0040-1625;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is close to data source and users, so terminals can execute tasks at the edge of network. In this way, the heavy load on core network can be relieved and tasks can be executed effectively. However, the demands of users vary from each other and users move all the time. It is difficult for the existing way of service supply to meet demands of all users. Cognitive Agent (CA) is put forward in this paper to help users cache and execute tasks on MEC in advance. In detail, CA is used to build personalized model combined with users’ behavior data. At the same time, it uses Long short-term memory neural network to forecast the moving trajectory of terminal equipment and the service types to be requested, uses the prediction result to generate caching strategy, cache business and shorten the delay of task execution. Besides, to further reduce the stress on MEC, we propose the collaboration of computing, communicating and caching resource with neighboring users’ equipment. To verify the effectiveness of CA, we build a model that assesses the performance of the system. Finally, we design a simulation experiment to execute resource request and resource collaboration. The result of the experiments show that CA can improve the efficiency of communication network, relieve the stress on network and improve the quality of services to users.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.08.001;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19318783;;;Cognitive agent, Mobile edge computing, Caching strategy, Resource collaboration;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Geo CPS: Spatial challenges and opportunities for CPS in the geographic dimension;Wanglin Yan and Takeo Sakairi;Journal of Urban Management;2019;Science@Direct;331-341;8;Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have brought great opportunities for geographical information systems (GIS) to be integrated with cyber-physical systems (CPS) in urban management. However, the term IoT and CPS are new in the GIS realm. This article reviews the concepts of IoT and CPS from the perspective of geospatial spaces and proposes the concept of Geo CPS to develop the potential of new technology in the geographic dimension. Two forms of Geo CPS are discussed: pseudo-CPS (PCPS), which projects spatial data onto a display without interaction among data sources, and true-CPS (TCPS), which handles data sources deeply and semantically. While PCPS already has wide industrial applications, TCPS is still in its infancy. The spatial challenge for CPS in geo space involves operating conditions in an open environment, and here, the human-machine system interface will be key. A transformation of our mindset relating to GIS can lead to the creation of new value-added geographical information services. This will require new schemes and platforms for data sharing, processing, security, and privacy, etc.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jum.2019.09.005;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2226585619301293;;;Internet of things (IoT), Space integration, Cyber-physical systems (CPS), Sensing, Processing and Accutation (SPA);;2226-5856;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Cross domain 2D-3D descriptor matching for unconstrained 6-DOF pose estimation;Uzair Nadeem and Mohammed Bennamoun and Roberto Togneri and Ferdous Sohel and Aref {Miri Rekavandi} and Farid Boussaid;Pattern Recognition;2023;Science@Direct;109655;142;This paper presents a novel approach for cross-domain descriptor matching between 2D and 3D modalities. The 2D-3D matching is applied to localize 2D images in 3D point clouds. Direct cross-domain matching allows our technique to localize images in any type of 3D point cloud without any constraints on the nature or mechanism by which it is obtained. We propose a learning based framework, called Desc-Matcher, to directly match features between the two modalities. A dataset of 2D and 3D features with corresponding locations in images and point clouds is generated to train the Desc-Matcher. To estimate the pose of an image in any 3D cloud, keypoints and feature descriptors are extracted from the query image and the point cloud. The trained Desc-Matcher is then used to match the features from the image and the point cloud. A robust pose estimator is used to predict the location and orientation of the query image from the corresponding positions of the matched 2D and 3D features. We carried out an extensive evaluation of the proposed method for indoor and outdoor scenarios and with different types of point clouds to verify the feasibility of our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reliably estimate the 6-DOF poses of query cameras in any type of 3D point cloud with high precision.

We demonstrate how IFC concepts are utilized to represent a shift report of a conventional tunneling project.

Although numerous studies on IIoT and BDA exist, only a few studies have explored the convergence of the two paradigms. In this study, we investigate the recent BDA technologies, algorithms and techniques that can lead to the development of intelligent IIoT systems. We devise a taxonomy by classifying and categorising the literature on the basis of important parameters (e.g. data sources, analytics tools, analytics techniques, requirements, industrial analytics applications and analytics types). We present the frameworks and case studies of the various enterprises that have benefited from BDA. We also enumerate the considerable opportunities introduced by BDA in IIoT. We identify and discuss the indispensable challenges that remain to be addressed, serving as future research directions.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.04.020;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X18313645;;;Internet of Things, Cyber-physical systems, Cloud computing, Analytics, Big data;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Relation-balanced graph convolutional network for 3D human pose estimation;Lu Chen and Qiong Liu;Image and Vision Computing;2023;Science@Direct;104841;140;Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been applied to 2D-to-3D human pose estimation (HPE) and have shown encouraging performance. However, existing GCNs model the relations between joints via individual kernels, which can be overly flexible and fail to capture common relational patterns due to the symmetric nature of the human body. Although some GCNs share kernels to capture common relations, the unified way for all neighbors limits relational diversity to some extent. In order to balance the diversity and commonality of relations, we conduct a comprehensive study of existing kernel-sharing strategies and propose a Relation-balanced Graph Convolutional Network (RbGC-Net). RbGC-Net introduces the Part-Specific Kernel-Sharing strategy (PSKS) that assigns kernels based on the semantic meanings of neighbors to establish specific relational patterns for different types of neighborhoods. Furthermore, RbGC-Net incorporates a Local–Global Feature Fusion module (LGFF) that extracts the local relations among joints and balances them with the final global relations to improve the interactions between joints. Compared with state-of-the-art methods for 3D HPE, our RbGC-Net achieves the optimal balance between model size and estimation errors. Results on two benchmark Human3.6 M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate the excellent performance and strong generalization ability of our pure GCN-based method.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imavis.2023.104841;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885623002159;;;3D human pose estimation, Graph convolutional network, Relation modeling, Feature fusion;;0262-8856;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Evaluation of 5G techniques affecting the deployment of smart hospital infrastructure: Understanding 5G, AI and IoT role in smart hospital;Arun Kumar and Aziz Nanthaamornphong and R. Selvi and J. Venkatesh and Mohammed H. Alsharif and Peerapong Uthansakul and Monthippa Uthansakul;Alexandria Engineering Journal;2023;Science@Direct;335-354;83;Smart Hospital will play a key role in improving the quality of services (QoS) related to the health sector. In the present scenario, it is impossible to accommodate an ageing population with the current infrastructure and facilities provided by conventional hospitals. However, the integration of technologies with the conventional hospital is enhancing the medical services and also making it easier for the public, who can save time and money by getting all the necessary medical facilities while sitting at home. The deployment of the fifth generation (5G) is taking place all over the world. The 5G network offers a better service that can be used in hospitals to make it a smart health service provider with online facilities such as video monitoring, suggesting a proper medical prescription based on medical data, remote surgery, and so on. High bandwidth, a fast data rate, low latency, and a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) are some requirements that need to be fulfilled by the 5G radio. In this work, we focus on improving the power savings, spectral access, latency, and Bit error rate (BER) of the advanced 5G waveforms such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In the first part of the article, we proposed a PAPR reduction algorithm to improve the power efficiency of the power amplifier (PA) for 5G waveforms. Several algorithms are applied to the 5G waveforms, and their performances are estimated in terms of PAPR curves. In the second part, we have utilised advanced detection algorithms to improve the signal detection of the 5G waveforms. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithms efficiently enhance the throughput of the framework. In the third part, we improve the spectral efficiency of the 5G waveforms by applying spectrum sensing (SS) algorithms. It is seen that the SS methods efficiently reduce the spectrum leakage of the multi-carrier waveforms (MCW). Finally, we examined the role and challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in smart hospitals. Overall, it is concluded that hospitals can become more effective, cut expenses, and provide better patient care with the aid of AI and IoT. Hospitals can improve patient outcomes and the state of the healthcare system as a whole by utilising these technologies.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2023.10.065;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016823009766;;;Smart hospital, Fifth Generation (5G), Latency, Spectral efficiency, AI, IoT;;1110-0168;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;BiPR-RL: Portrait relighting via bi-directional consistent deep reinforcement learning;Yukai Song and Guangxin Xu and Xiaoyan Zhang and Zhijun Zhang;Computer Vision and Image Understanding;2024;Science@Direct;103889;239;Portrait relighting via deep reinforcement learning could conduct portrait relighting by sequentially predicting local light editing strokes, simulating image editing by artists using brush strokes. It is a locally effective, scale-invariant and interpretable method, which yields state-of-the-art results in relighting wild portrait images. However, it still has problems due to the lack of supervision information on intermediate processes, which makes the reinforcement learning agent not receive sufficient feedback during the exploration process. This will cause incorrect strokes in the relighting. To further optimize the relighting effect, we take advantage of the fact that the light editing actions are invertible and the inverse actions can generate a backward sequence of states. The backward state sequence also provide useful supervision signals as they convey information about the future states given the action choices. Therefore, we propose to combine the forward and the backward state sequence predictions to improve the learning efficiency for portrait relighting. Using the bi-directional state sequences, we design corresponding bi-directional consistent rewards to guide the model to explore the actions with higher accuracy to maximize the performance of the proposed method. The proposed approach is used for portrait relighting tasks based on both SH-lighting and reference images. The results show that our method has further improved the performance by avoiding wrong strokes. Meanwhile, our method performs better than SOTA methods in producing locally effective relighting images for wild portrait images.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103889;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314223002692;;;Bi-directional, Portrait relighting, Deep reinforcement learning;;1077-3142;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;VISHnu: An approach to support the personalization of self-expressive avatars using context-awareness;Ailton Ribeiro and Vaninha Vieira and Lynn Alves and Cristiano Maciel;International Journal of Human-Computer Studies;2024;Science@Direct;103243;185;The avatar is a digital character that represents a person in a virtual environment, such as the metaverse. It is widely used in games and is also becoming a reality in other domains. Research indicates that the characteristics of a person’s avatar can influence his/her behavior while using a system, improving the sense of presence, immersion, and self-expression. A gap is how to support developers proposing avatar personalization, considering a user’s context, and understanding how context-awareness applied to avatars influences self-expression. In this article, we investigate how to support the development of self-expressive avatars. We present VISHnu, an approach developed to support the formalization of the use of context for avatar personalization. We conducted three evaluations to investigate the potential and feasibility of the VISHnu approach with specialists and developers: a focus group (n = 6), interviews (n = 6), and a questionnaire (n = 12). In addition to guidelines derived from mixed qualitative methods and data triangulation, including insights from the literature review, we present two tangible artifacts—the checklist and glossary. These artifacts provide a robust initial foundation for developers and enthusiasts aiming to create avatar customization solutions aligned with advancements in immersive worlds like the metaverse.

;Novel method for augmented reality guided endodontics: An in vitro study;Marco Farronato and Andres Torres and Mariano S. Pedano and Reinhilde Jacobs;Journal of Dentistry;2023;Science@Direct;104476;132;"Objective
The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy in endodontics of a novel augmented reality (AR) method for guided access cavity preparation in 3D-printed jaws.
Methods
Two operators with different levels of experience in endodontics performed pre-planned virtually guided access cavities through a novel markerless AR system on three sets of 3D-printed jaw models (Objet Connex 350, Stratasys) mounted on a phantom. After the treatment, a post-operative high-resolution CBCT scan (NewTom VGI Evo, Cefla) was taken for each model and registered to the pre-operative model. All the access cavities were then digitally reconstructed by filling the cavity area using 3D medical software (3-Matic 15.0, materialize). For the anterior teeth and the premolars, the deviation at the coronal and apical entry points as well as the angular deviation of the access cavity were compared to the virtual plan. For the molars, the deviation at the coronal entry point was compared to the virtual plan. Additionally, the surface area of all access cavities at the entry point was measured and compared to the virtual plan. Descriptive statistics for each parameter were performed. A 95% confidence interval was calculated.
Results
A total of 90 access cavities were drilled up to a depth of 4 mm inside the tooth. The mean deviation in the frontal teeth and in the premolars at the entry point was 0.51 mm and 0.77 mm at the apical point, with a mean angular deviation of 8.5° and a mean surface overlap of 57%. The mean deviation for the molars at the entry point was 0.63 mm, with a mean surface overlap of 82%.
Conclusion
The use of AR as a digital guide for endodontic access cavity drilling on different teeth showed promising results and might have potential for clinical use. However, further development and research might be needed before in vivo validation.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2023.104476;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571223000635;;;Visual-inertial odometry, Guided endodontics, Augmented reality, Cone-beam computed tomography, Minimal invasive endodontics;;0300-5712;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

First, we encode the depth images into three channels using the HHA representation to obtain the similar structure to the RGB images. Second, a multi-modal fusing features learning FCN with attention model is constructed, which can extract hierarchical multi-modal fusing features of the samples in RGB-D data. The attention model is adopted to exploit the importance weight of RGB and depth to fuse the features of the two modalities at multiple layers effectively, rather than concatenating the feature vectors of the two channels simply. Finally, the hierarchical multi-modal fusing features of the samples are input to the Efficient Convolution Operators (ECO) tracker, and the update strategy is improved by the occlusion detection in the depth images.

Fast technological advances are being made, especially in the field of smart phones, that facilitate the conduct of our daily activities in many areas such as driving. The ever-increasing number of vehicles on roads increases the likelihood of traffic accidents, resulting in higher number of deaths and serious injuries to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Among the main causes of road accidents are over speeding, unsafe lane jumping, and failure to keep a safe distance between vehicles, to name a few. In an attempt to contribute to the improvement of road traffic safety, we have developed an Augmented Reality-based Smart Vehicle Driver Assistance application. The application is designed to enhance vehicle driver’s safety, in particular, but is also considered to lead to incremental improvement of safety of road traffic. The application can run on both Android and iOS platforms and incorporates several beneficial features required by a vehicle driver such as monitoring of vehicle speed, warning the driver in case of lane deviation, detection of road signs, and to alert the driver if the vehicle is not being driven at a safe distance from the vehicle in front. In addition to providing information to improve safe driving, the application also helps the vehicle driver save parking location of the vehicle in order to efficiently identify the parking location when retrieving the vehicle. This feature is very useful at large and unfamiliar parking areas, such as at airports or one-off large public gatherings, especially in inclement weather. The application also includes other useful functions such as the payment of parking fees, storage of information regarding vehicle maintenance, and keeping the vehicle legal document up to date.

It cleverly blends the virtual and real worlds, allowing users to create, communicate, and transact in virtual form. With the rapid development of emerging technologies including augmented reality, virtual reality and blockchain, the metaverse system is becoming more and more sophisticated and widely used in various fields such as social, tourism, industry and economy. However, the high level of interaction with the real world also means a huge risk of privacy leakage both for individuals and enterprises, which has hindered the wide deployment of metaverse. Then, it is inevitable to apply privacy computing techniques in the framework of metaverse, which is a current research hotspot. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive research on the necessity, taxonomy and challenges when privacy computing meets metaverse. Specifically, we first introduce the underlying technologies and various applications of metaverse, on which we analyze the challenges of data usage in metaverse, especially data privacy.

In this study, a Metaverse sport interactive system based on triboelectric nanogenerators has been developed, which realizes a real-time interaction among human beings, devices, and the internet. This Metaverse sport interactive system is composed of a self-powered anaerobic power meter (APM), a wireless transmission module, personalized data analysis based on the professional Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) method, and an augmented reality (AR) application. By leveraging the WAnT method, the power (PP), mean power (MP), and fatigue index (FI) are tested, which indeed reflect the explosive power, speed endurance, and endurance. Meanwhile, the data is transmitted to the cloud via the wireless transmission module, and the users can freely explore the Metaverse through AR application.

For this reason, numerous learning and research factories have been build up during the last decade. The aim of this paper is to present an interdisciplinary concept model for a learning and research factory aiming to increase significantly the digital competences of concerned stakeholders. The proposed model has three dimensions: (i) content, (ii) function and (iii) methodology and is realized through a specific structure (Lab-in-Lab). Based on this concept model, the Smart Production Lab (Smart Lab) has been designed and implemented by the Institute of Industrial Management at FH JOANNEUM University of applied sciences, Austria. Essentially the Smart Lab is about the digital transformation of connecting businesses – horizontally along the entire value chain and vertically with focus on data generation, integration, and usage. The development of use cases in the two maturity levels – state-of-the-art and research – allows the transfer of knowledge of digital transformation processes for companies as well as active learning scenarios for the qualification of future industrial engineers.

;Load-aware dynamic controller placement based on deep reinforcement learning in SDN-enabled mobile cloud-edge computing networks;Chenglin Xu and Cheng Xu and Bo Li and Siqi Li and Tao Li;Computer Networks;2023;Science@Direct;109900;234;Software-defined networks (SDNs) can improve network resource utilization and optimize the performance of mobile cloud-edge computing networks (MECCNs) through unified and flexible network management. However, network traffic in MECCNs can change over time and space, which affects the performance of the control plane in an SDN. Further, an MECCN may require the temporary addition of network access points, further reducing the network management capabilities of the control plane. To ensure that the control plane can handle the constant changes in network traffic, adapt to dynamic changes in network access points, and provide continuous and efficient network management functions, this study focuses on the dynamic controller placement problem in SDN-enabled MECCNs. We study the deployment of a two-layer control plane and accordingly construct the corresponding delay, load balancing, and control reliability models. Next, we construct a joint optimization problem considering the developed delay, load balancing, and control reliability, and solve this problem using an algorithm based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms on a variable-node network.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109900;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128623003456;;;Software-defined network, Controller placement problem, Variable-node network, Deep deterministic policy gradient;;1389-1286;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Virtual reality (VR) has become a powerful and promising tool for education, and numerous studies have investigated the application and effectiveness of VR education. However, few studies have focused on the expectations and concerns of teenagers regarding head-mounted displays (HMDs), which are used for this purpose.
Methods
In this paper, we aim to explore the current problems and necessary advancements required in VR education based on a survey of 163 senior high school students who experience VR educational content for 1h. The usability and comfort of the HMD system, the physical and psychological effects on the students, and their preferences and concerns are investigated.

These disruptive technologies are at the center of the fourth industrial revolution, but are we ready yet to educate and prepare new generations to help society, science, and humanity adapt them? How can we change the current curriculum to reflect these technological innovations? How can we help the new generation to develop not only left-brain skills but also right-brain skills? The Netherlands is the second largest food exporter in the world after the United States and the agricultural related exports generated €45 Billion in 2018 for the economy. R&D in Dutch companies and innovation in universities in the Netherlands play an important and active role in this context. In this paper, we provide a general framework for supporting education in the context of Industry 4.0.

Researchers have developed different algorithms and techniques to automatically track the gaze position and direction, which are helpful in different applications. Research on eye tracking is increasing owing to its ability to facilitate many different tasks, particularly for the elderly or users with special needs. This study aims to explore and review eye tracking concepts, methods, and techniques by further elaborating on efficient and effective modern approaches such as machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. These approaches have been in use for more than two decades and are heavily used in the development of recent eye tracking applications. The results of this study indicate that ML and IoT are important aspects in evolving eye tracking applications owing to their ability to learn from existing data, make better decisions, be flexible, and eliminate the need to manually re-calibrate the tracker during the eye tracking process. In addition, they show that eye tracking techniques have more accurate detection results compared with traditional event-detection methods.

;GP-NFSP: Decentralized task offloading for mobile edge computing with independent reinforcement learning;Jiaxin Hou and Meng Chen and Haijun Geng and Rongzhen Li and Jianyuan Lu;Future Generation Computer Systems;2023;Science@Direct;205-217;141;In Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), offloading tasks from mobile devices to edge servers may accelerate the processing speed and save the energy of the devices, hence improving device users’ quality of experience. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for offload decision making. RL seeks long-term cumulative benefits and is proved useful for a sequence of decisions, thus is well suited for the work. Due to privacy and security concerns, mobile devices may be unwilling to expose their local information, leading to a fully decentralized MEC environment. Independent RL (IRL) emerges as a promising solution for this scenario. However, IRL solutions are faced with the non-stationarity issue, which arises when the components are changing their policies. In this paper, we proposing adopting the Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) architecture for offload decision making. NFSP explicitly tackles the non-stationarity issue with the built-in self-play mechanism, and uses a mixed strategy consisting of deep RL and the past average strategy, which is approximated by supervised deep learning. Furthermore, we use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm as the RL component and exploit the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to deal with the partial-observability issue in fully decentralized MEC. We conduct extensive simulation experiment, the result of which shows that our method outperforms the raw IRL approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2022.11.025;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X22003867;;;Mobile edge computing, Computation offloading, Deep reinforcement learning, Neural fictitious self-play, Proximal policy optimization, Quality of experience;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object
(PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical
object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the
original object within a specific application context. To fully
determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the
state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the
manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging
in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars),
multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for
the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the
``softwarization{''} of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT
definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed
as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves)
of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and
business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities.
Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and
how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a
generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by
the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in
order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This

Campbell;Telematics and Informatics Reports;2023;Science@Direct;100034;9;There is an increasing interest in creating interactive learning applications using innovative interaction technologies, especially in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects. Recent developments in machine learning have allowed for nearly perfect hand-tracking recognition, introducing a touchless modality for interaction within Augmented Reality (AR) environments. However, the research community has not explored the pedagogical approach of Kinesthetic Learning or “Learning by Doing”, hand tracking, and machine learning agents combined with Augmented Reality technology. Fundamentally, this exploration of touchless interaction technologies has taken on new importance in the new post-COVID world. Meanwhile, machine learning has gained attention for its ability to enhance personalized learning and play a vital new role as a virtual instructor. This paper proposes a novel approach called the AGILEST approach, which uses machine learning Agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in STEM education through touchless interaction. The first case study for this approach will be an AR learning application for chemistry. This application uses real-time touchless hand interaction for kinesthetic learning and uses a machine learning agent to act as both trainer and assessor of the user. The evaluation of this research has been conducted remotely through a usability study with expert reviewers, which includes 15 young researchers with peer-reviewed work in Human-Computer Interaction & AR and 2 subject experts STEM teachers at the secondary school level.

;An autonomous computation offloading strategy in Mobile Edge Computing: A deep learning-based hybrid approach;Ali Shakarami and Ali Shahidinejad and Mostafa Ghobaei-Arani;Journal of Network and Computer Applications;2021;Science@Direct;102974;178;The fast growth of under developing internet-based technologies has been leading to propose promising methods to handle the heterogeneous massive volume of data produced by pervasive smart equipments such as handy mobile devices. Thanks to the mentioned technologies, these mobile devices can run critical business/entertainment applications such as Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, vehicular networks, and media streaming. However, due to such devices' inherent limitations, some emerging computation environments such as Mobile Edge Computing have been introduced to achieve some essential requirements such as low latency, low energy consumption, and low cost. In the literature, offloading is a technique to transfer the burden of the mobile devices' work incurred by running applications' requests to these computation environments. On the other hand, exploring the computation environment to find the most efficient place to execute such requests is challenging work to achieve. In addition, different researches have been proposed to cope with the management problems of the offloading criterion. In this paper, an autonomous computation offloading framework is proposed to address some challenges related to time-intensive and resource-intensive applications. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the proposed autonomous framework has not been explored as a control model for self-management in the computation offloading criterion. Besides, to cope with the large dimension of the offloading decision-making problem, different simulations including Deep Neural Networks, multiple linear regression, hybrid model, and Hidden Markov Model as the planning module of the mentioned autonomous methodology have been conducted. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid model can appropriately fit the problem with near-optimal accuracy regarding the offloading decision-making, the latency, and the energy consumption predictions in the proposed self-management framework.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2021.102974;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804521000011;;;Offloading, Mobile edge computing, Machine learning, Neural networks, Hidden markov model, Regression;;1084-8045;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Within the virtual farm, users can explore various sites where dairy cows are raised and gain insights into dairy production processes using a head-mounted display (HMD). This simulation was demonstrated at local libraries, involving 48 public participants. We collected and analyzed participants’ feedback on various aspects, including usability and their overall perceptions, to assess the simulation’s effectiveness as an agricultural education tool.

communication technologies, drawing increasing numbers of professionals.
Higher education institutions, however, are struggling to keep abreast

to this, the field is developing so rapidly that existing courses

art, identifying common needs and problems in existing courses which
focus on AR. We then detail a skills framework comprised of 12 groups of
skills suitable to meet industry needs, and built upon it two model
lesson plans for a foundation and an advanced course. We conclude with a

L.;PRESENCE-VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY;2022;ISI Web of Science;107-146;31;"In the Software Engineering Education (SEE) context, virtual worlds have
been used in order to improve learning outcomes. However, there is a gap
in the literature in order to characterize the use of the Metaverse for
SEE. The objective of this work is to characterize the state of the art
of virtual worlds in SEE and provide research opportunities and
challenges to fill the limitations found. We conducted a systematic
literature review, and we established 8 research questions that guided
the study, as well as performed data extraction. We report on 17 primary
studies that deal mostly with immersive experiences in SEE. The results
show some limitations: few Software Engineering (SE) topics are covered;
most applications simulate environments and do not explore new ways of
viewing and interacting; there is no interoperability between virtual
worlds; learning analysis techniques are not applied; and biometric data
are not considered in the validations of the studies. Although there are
virtual worlds for SEE, the results indicate the need to develop
mechanisms in order to support the integration between virtual worlds.
Therefore, based on the findings of the review, we established a set of
components grouped by 5 layers to enable the Metaverse for SEE through
fundamental requirements. We hope that this work can motivate promising
research in order to foster immersive learning experiences in SE through
the Metaverse.";;10.1162/pres\_a\_00371;;;;;;1054-7460;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The Role of Technology to Teaching and Learning Sign Languages: ASystematic Mapping;Falvo Jr, Venilton and Scatalon, Lilian Passos and Barbosa, EllenFrancine;;2020;ISI Web of Science;;;"Context: The teaching and learning process has become essential for the
evolution of the society as a whole. However, there are still major
challenges for achieving the global goals of education, especially if we
consider the portion of the population with some type of physical
disability. In this context, according to World Federation of the Deaf
(WFD), deaf children face many difficulties in education due to
inappropriate learning environments. Also, this problem is compounded by
the lack of consistency worldwide in the provision of sign language
interpreting and translation. Motivation: However, the advent of
technology is having a significant impact on the way that sign language
interpreters and translators work. In this sense, the union between
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and modern pedagogical
practices can be the genesis for the creation of a global learning
environment based on sign languages. Objective: In this scenario, this
work aims to: (i) obtain an overview of the areas of Software
Engineering and their technological solutions in the fields of teaching
and learning sign languages; (ii) identify the main educational topics;
and (iii) the most investigated sign languages. Method: Therefore, we
conduct a Systematic Mapping (SM) with a focus on technologies applied
in the teaching and learning of sign languages. Results: We selected 139
primary studies, using a search approach that includes both manual and
automated searches, in addition to providing quality criteria for
evaluating results. Thereby, we obtained pertinent information about the
implemented solutions, in addition to the educational topics and sign
languages covered. Conclusions: We conclude that technologies have
already contributed to the teaching and learning of sign languages. In
this context, different approaches were found, from solutions on
traditional platforms (Web, Mobile and Desktop) to the use of Augmented
Reality (AR) in smart glasses. However, no solution aims to enable
communication between different sign languages, which shows a limitation
that can motivate even more innovative research.";;;;;;;;0190-5848;;IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), Uppsala, SWEDEN, OCT21-24, 2020;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Two-Stage Deep Regression Enhanced Depth Estimation From a Single RGB Image;Sun, Jianyuan and Wang, Zidong and Yu, Hui and Zhang, Shu and Dong, Junyu and Gao, Pengxiang;IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing;2022;IEEE Digital Library;719-727;10;Depth estimation plays a significant role in industrial applications, e.g., augmented reality, robotic mapping and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches for capturing depth, such as laser or depth sensor based methods, are difficult to use in most scenarios due to the limitations of high system cost and limited operational conditions. As an inexpensive and convenient approach, using the computational models to estimate depth from a single RGB image offers a preferable way for the depth prediction. Although the design of computational models to estimate the depth map has been widely investigated, the majority of models suffers from low prediction accuracy due to the sole utilization of a one-stage regression strategy. Inspired by both theoretical and practical success of two-stage regression, we propose a two-stage deep regression model, which is composed of two state-of-the-art network architectures, i.e., the fully convolutional residual network (FCRN) and the conditional generation adversarial network (cGAN). FCRN has been proved to possess a strong prediction ability for depth prediction, but fine details in the depth map are still incomplete. Accordingly, we have improved the existing cGAN model to refine the FCRN-based depth prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed two-stage deep regression model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.;;10.1109/TETC.2020.3034559;;;;"Predictive models;Task analysis;Estimation;Network architecture;Residual neural networks;Computational modeling;Robot sensing systems;Depth prediction;a single RGB image;the rough depth map;neural networks";;2168-6750;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;STEP UP: Systematically Motivating the Children with Low Psychological Maturity Level and Disabled Children using Gamification and Human Computer Interaction;Dharmarathne, R. S. C. K and Medagedara, K. A and Madhubashinee, N. B. W. N. and Maitipe, P. T. and Sriyaratna, Disni and Abeywardena, Kavinga;;2022;IEEE Digital Library;1-6;;Children are the future of this world. Therefore, teaching them to have a better future is very important. Also, as the adults we have to motivate them to overcome the obstacles and challenges they face throughout their lifetime. When considering about the children, there are various types of children in our society. As examples there are children with special needs and there are children who are mentally and physically stable. Children with special needs require special attention than the other children. These kinds of children with special needs have various types of development disabilities. They are children with low psychological maturity level, autism, down syndrome, genetic disorders etc. We have proposed a system to motivate these children who are with low psychological maturity level named as ‘STEP-UP’. This system is a combination of four individual modules that have the common goal to motivate these kinds of children which were implemented using gamification, Image processing, machine learning and Human Computer Interaction. One individual module is focused on disabled children, and it will motivate those children using gamification. Another two modules are focusing on the children who are with low psychological maturity level. And that will motivate those kinds of children using gamification and HCI based technologies like Virtual Reality. The other module is a protocol to secure the data sent between the system and the database. The common goal of this overall STEP-UP system is to motivate the children with low psychological maturity level and disabled children.;;10.1109/I2CT54291.2022.9824182;;;;"Human computer interaction;Protocols;Image processing;Psychology;Virtual environments;Focusing;Medical services;Gamification;Machine Learning;Human Computer Interaction;Image Processing;Virtual Reality;Augmented Reality;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)";;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;SGPL: An Intelligent Game-based Secure Collaborative Communication Scheme for Metaverse over 5G and Beyond Networks;Chen, Miaojiang and Liu, Anfeng and Xiong, Neal N. and Song, Hongbing and Leung, Victor C. M.;IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications;2023;IEEE Digital Library;1-1;;Human-centric communication metaverse relies on the convergent integration of multiple existing technologies such as 5G and beyond networks, virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital twins, and thus their security vulnerabilities and vulnerability to interference attacks may also be inherited by the metaverse. In particular, existing security policies may be inefficient for communication interference problems encountered in multi-device collaborative computing in a metaverse 5G environment and lack adaptability to metaverse applications. In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent game anti-interference collaborative computing model that accurately describes the interference relationships among source devices, cooperating devices, and interferers in metaverse collaborative computing.We model the offensive and defensive confrontation between multiple metaverse devices as a Stackelberg game, where the source device is the leader, the collaborative computing device acts as the sub-leader, adjusts its antijamming strategy according to the source device’s strategy to improve the source device’s communication anti-jamming performance, and the jammer acts as the follower. We design an intelligent Stackelberg Game-theoretic Policy-based Learning (SGPL) algorithm for jamming resistance in metaverses over 5G and Beyond Networks, where the leaders (co-computing devices) update their training parameters using the total derivatives of the objective function, while the followers (i.e., jammers) update their training parameters using an independent gradient dynamics strategy. Loops are eased and convergence is accelerated by introducing differential dynamics into the leader training network to reflect the interaction structure of the critic and actor network layers. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SGPL algorithm in metaverse anti-jamming countermeasures. The proposed SGPL algorithm has the potential to be generalized to other metaverse applications with multi-user attack and defense characteristics.;;10.1109/JSAC.2023.3345403;;;;"Jamming;Metaverse;Collaboration;Games;Interference;5G mobile communication;Heuristic algorithms;Metaverse;Human-centric communication;collaborative computing;anti-jamming;5G and Beyond Networks";;1558-0008;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Combining the metaverse with healthcare results in a unique real-space experience that enables both patients and physicians to evaluate the health of their respective patients and engage in in-person interactions. The metaverse is a collection of technologies that includes elements of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, the Internet of Things, and more. The integration of healthcare and the metaverse has made it possible to focus on the patient's health in a more accurate, effective, and precise manner. Using the many imaging technologies in the metaverse, researchers are working to speed up the usage of the metaverse for patient diagnosis in addition to clinical diagnostics. It is no longer necessary for a doctor to be there in person while making a diagnosis. In order to diagnose patients in a highly effective and exact manner, there is a lot of research being done to improve the metaverse environment. This study's main focus will be on how the metaverse has streamlined the healthcare industry and the various healthcare amenities it offers. This article offers a thorough examination of clinical and diagnostic developments achieved in the metaverse in an effort to enhance the field of healthcare in the metaverse.

With a trending Metaverse applications using augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), it is easier and interesting to teach sign language remotely using an avatar that mimics the gesture of a person using AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based system. There are various proposed methods and datasets for English SL (sign language); however, it is limited for Arabic sign language. Therefore, we present our collected and annotated Arabic Sign Language Letters Dataset (ArSL21L) consisting of 14202 images of 32 letter signs with various backgrounds collected from 50 people. We benchmarked our ArSL21L dataset on state-of-the-art object detection models, i.e., 4 versions of YOLOv5. Among the models, YOLOv5l achieved the best result with COCOmAP of 0.83. Moreover, we provide comparison results of classification task between ArSL2018 dataset, the only Arabic sign language letter dataset for classification task, and our dataset by running classification task on in-house short video. The results revealed that the model trained on our dataset has a superior performance over the model trained on ArSL2018. Moreover, we have created our prototype avatar which can mimic the ArSL (Arabic Sign Language) gestures for Metaverse applications. Finally, we believe, ArSL21L and the ArSL avatar will offer an opportunity to enhance the research and educational applications for not only the PwHL, but also in general real and virtual world applications.

It encourages a next level of education that is free, creative and convenient. Introduction of virtual learning to the primary schools can provide a joyful learning experience to the students. The project is built using Augmented Reality technology. This technique involves 3D learning that aids the learning process and has a greater impact on the children's learning, as they are more likely to remember the facts and lessons learned. It helps children identify and organize visual information and learn skills easily. It's simply because visuals hold more appeal than plain text to those curious and intuitive young minds. Understanding and grasping concepts in their curriculum is made simple and fun with this technique of learning. The software technology used to build this application is unity3D (software) and Vuforia web portal (to create a database) as a prerequisite. Some image targets are set so that the camera can recognize the images and display a 3d model based on it. It can be done by adding some 3D assets in required fields and it is altered accordingly. After setting all these we will be able to extract an apk file from the scene created in software which can be installed in Android or iOS mobile devices or tabs. The user will be able to operate it just by scanning the specific image targets. This project is implemented at school level which can benefit in various ways. It helps to spark kids' interest in subjects. This approach promotes active learning and can encourage kids to use their creativity for their own pleasure. As they get older, the creative skills they developed in the process can be used to solve every day or even global problems.

;An Emotionally Responsive Virtual Parent for Pediatric Nursing Education: A Framework for Multimodal Momentary and Accumulated Interventions;Nam, Hyeongil and Kim, Chanhee and Kim, Kangsoo and Yeo, Ji-Young and Park, Jong-Il;;2022;IEEE Digital Library;365-374;;Immersive virtual reality (VR) simulations become more and more popular for basic nursing skills training in a realistic VR environment. However, there is still a gap of research that specifically focuses on pediatric nursing interventions where nurse trainees should be able to recognize and deal with the patient parent’s emotional responses appropriately. In this paper, we propose a novel nursing intervention analysis framework that evaluates the user’s nursing performance, by analyzing not only their momentary multimodal (verbal and nonverbal) behaviors, but also accumulated intervention behaviors that capture the overall nursing context. Based on the proposed framework, we developed an immersive VR-based nursing education system with an emotionally responsive virtual parent, and designed a realistic pediatric nursing intervention scenario in collaboration with a subject-matter expert (a nursing faculty in our university). An expert-evaluation study with professional nurses was conducted to assess the potential of the developed system—in particular, the effects of the emotionally responsive virtual parent— as an effective education tool, by comparing with an emotionally static/neutral virtual parent. Several factors of learning experience, e.g., immersion, realism, learning efficacy, and usefulness, were examined through a subjective questionnaire, and the results support the effectiveness of our system in clinical practice or educational settings.

This paper thus proposes various methodologies and technologies which we have used to effectively implement the said system in the fashion industry using various augmented reality and artificial intelligence techniques for a holistic user experience.;;10.1109/IISEC56263.2022.9998275;;;;"Industries;Pandemics;Software algorithms;User experience;Real-time systems;Electronic commerce;Virtualization;AR in fashion;MediaPipe;Pose Estimation;3D Modeling;Face landmarks";;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Geometry Consistency Of Augmented Reality Based On Semantics;Quan, Hongyan and Yao, Mingwei and Qian, XiaoXiao;;2021;IEEE Digital Library;1950-1954;;In augmented reality, for achieving geometric consistency in the perspective projection virtual-real, we propose a semantic consistency method to achieve the fusion between virtual and real objects with selected segmented objects in the real scene as references. The proposed framework maintains the three-dimensional structure of the scene by satisfying the global semantic map of the real scene. It takes the segmented objects in the scene as the basic unit, and executes the virtual and real fusion for ensuring the accuracy of the relative geometric position of the virtual objects. In addition, a multi-task network architecture is proposed to optimize the camera parameters based on the scene segmentation. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed augmented reality geometric consistency framework, and confirm that our strategy has the capability of fusing the virtual and real geometric consistency.;;10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414088;;;;"Geometry;Deep learning;Semantics;Signal processing;Network architecture;Cameras;Image sequences;Augmented reality;geometric consistency;semantic segmentation;multitask learning";;2379-190X;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Towards Immersive Learning in Object-Oriented Paradigm: A Preliminary Study;Fernandes, Filipe and Werner, Cláudia;;2019;IEEE Digital Library;59-68;;Object-Oriented Paradigm Teaching is mandatory in the curriculum of the courses of the Computing area. Students are taught fundamental concepts about this paradigm, such as class, object, encapsulation, polymorphism, generalization and composition. One of the major challenges of Software Engineering is to teach complex and abstract concepts in a short time, with examples or simple projects done in academic environments. Virtual Reality has demonstrated advantages applied to Education, providing immersive experiences and new ways of visualization and interaction. However, this technology has not been extensively explored in Software Engineering. In this sense, this paper aims to present a disruptive method of teaching and learning support on fundamentals in object orientation paradigm based on Immersive Learning, called OO Game VR. In addition, an initial heuristic evaluation was performed with 6 subjects in order to identify usability problems. Despite problems found related to support learning, navigation and orientation, the natural expression of action and clear entry and exit points, the subjects were able to perform all the tasks, showing indications that the application has the potential to support teaching of OOP teaching through Immersive Learning. In future works, the usability problems will be fixed and specific methods will be applied for measuring influence immersion on learning outcomes.;;10.1109/SVR.2019.00026;;;;"Education;Games;Software engineering;Usability;Avatars;Monitoring;immersive learning;object-oriented paradigm;software engineering education;virtual reality";;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

A makeover has become a necessity when attending divergent functions, and makeup used on diverse occasions varies in style. Choosing the perfect makeup that best suits a person is challenging unless they have years of expertise with cosmetics. This paper proposes a “Virtual Makeover and Makeup Recommendation System” to eliminate the need to be concerned about the appearance after applying makeup. The proposed system enables real-time makeup simulation in an Augmented Reality (AR) environment and recommends makeup styles considering skin tone, colour of clothing and hair, type of clothing and occasion to be attended with makeup. The personal traits of a user would be automatically detected and processed to generate recommendations for makeup products, namely lipstick, foundation and eyeshadow. Complications of wasting makeup products and time, and cleaning makeup can be mitigated by using a real-time makeup simulation system. Recommendations generated by the application assist the users to decide on makeup styles and provides a better user experience. The proposed system is developed with the aid of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.;;10.1109/ICAC54203.2021.9671133;;;;"Hair;Deep learning;Clothing;Color;Real-time systems;User experience;Skin;virtual makeup;hair colour detection;makeup recommendation;skin tone detection;clothing detection";;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Mobile Augmented Reality System for Emergency Response;Sharma, Sharad;;2023;IEEE Digital Library;402-406;;There are a wide variety of mobile phone emergency response applications exist for both indoor and outdoor environments. However, outdoor applications mostly provide accident and navigation information to users, and indoor applications are limited to the unavailability of GPS positioning and WiFi access problems. This paper describes the proposed mobile augmented reality system (MARS) that allows both outdoor and indoor users to retrieve and manage information for emergency response and navigation that is spatially registered with the real world. The proposed MARS utilizes feature extraction for location sensing in indoor environments as during emergencies GPS and WiFi systems might not work. This paper describes the implementation of this MARS deployed on tablets and smartphones for building evacuation purposes. The MARS delivers critical evacuation information to smartphone users in the indoor environment and navigation information in the outdoor environments. A limited user study was conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed MARS using the mobile phone usability questionnaire (MPUQ) framework. The results show that AR features were well integrated into the MARS and it will help identify the nearest exit in the building during the emergency evacuation.;;10.1109/SERA57763.2023.10197820;;;;"Mars;Navigation;Buildings;Emergency services;Indoor environment;Sensors;Augmented reality;Mobile augmented reality system;evacuation;navigation;Augmented Reality emergency response;mobile application;two-dimensional/three-dimensional visualizations";;2770-8209;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Effect of augmented reality–based rehabilitation of hand burns on hand function in children: A randomized controlled trial;Khalaf Marran Khamees and Kolsoum Deldar and Omid Yazarlu and Alaa M. Tuama and Raha Ganji and Seyed Reza Mazlom and Razieh Froutan;Journal of Hand Therapy;2024;Science@Direct;;;"Background
Despite the use of traditional rehabilitation methods, hand function may still remain impaired in children suffering from burn injuries.
Purpose
This study aimed to assess the impact of implementing an augmented reality (AR) rehabilitation booklet designed for pediatric hand burn on their hand functionality.
Study design
This was a randomized controlled trial.
Methods
Seventy-two children, aged 8-14 years with a hand burn, were randomly allocated into intervention (n = 36) and control (n = 36) groups. Children in the control group received routine rehabilitation program, while in the intervention group, children performed exercises using a printed booklet with related AR application. The Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test was completed before the intervention at the time of the patients' discharge and 1 month later.
Results
The results of analysis of covariance based on baseline- and fully-adjusted models showed significant intervention effect after discharge as well as after intervention for hand function (mean difference [95% confidence interval] for discharge: −8.2 [−15.0 to −1.4] and for after intervention: −74.0 [−88.8 to −59.1]) and the items (all p < 0.05), except for writing and lifting large light objects for both after discharge and after intervention measures (all p-value > 0.05).
Conclusions
A significant decrease in the total time taking to complete the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group 1 month after discharge. Rehabilitation of children with hand burns, using printed educational booklet with related AR application, improves their hand function.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jht.2023.10.009;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894113023001709;;;Augmented reality, Rehabilitation, Hand function, RCT, Children;;0894-1130;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents: 20 years of Research on Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics Volume 1: Methods, Behavior, Cognition;;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;37;The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive overview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and one another in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors, with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students, and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated using different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human–agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism, and games.;;;;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares: What We Must Do;Baecker, Ronald M. and Grudin, Jonathan;;2024;ACM Digital Library;;56;This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past.

;Software: A Technical History;Tracy, Kim W.;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;38;Software history has a deep impact on current software designers, computer scientists, and technologists. System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include “old” software and “historical” programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques.Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.;;;;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This study majorly targets a rigorous review of both the published form of literature and the least attended literature, i.e., grey literature. Apart from the digital libraries, the papers and other instances of information have been gathered from the grey sources like google patents, archives, technical reports, app stores, etc., culminating in 262 instances. After the heedful filtration imposed on both white and grey literature, the final pool of studies has been investigated for eight formulated research questions. The answers extracted have been analyzed, providing both quantitative and qualitative insights. The analysis and surveys have systematically summed up the potentials of both white and grey shades of literature present on MER and brought exciting extractions out of 155 formal white literature and 107 grey sources.

;Edge computing: A grounded theory study;P\'{e}rez, Jorge and D\'{\i}az, Jessica and Berrocal, Javier and L\'{o}pez-Viana, Ram\'{o}n and Gonz\'{a}lez-Prieto, \'{A}ngel;Computing;2022;ACM Digital Library;2711–2747;104;IoT edge computing is a new computing paradigm “in the IoT domain” for performing calculations and processing at the edge of the network, closer to the user and the source of the data. This paradigm is relatively recent, and, together with cloud and fog computing, there may be some confusion about its meaning and implications. This paper aims to help practitioners and researchers better understand what the industry thinks about what IoT edge computing is, and the expected benefits and challenges associated with this paradigm. We conducted a survey using a semi-structured in-depth questionnaire to collect qualitative data from relevant stakeholders from 29 multinational companies and qualitatively analyzed these data using the Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz) method. Several researchers participated in the coding process (collaborative coding). To ensure consensus on the constructs that support the theory and thus improve the rigor of qualitative research, we conducted an intercoder agreement analysis. From the analysis, we have derived a substantive and analytic theory of what companies perceive about IoT edge computing, its benefits and challenges. The theory is substantive in that the scope of validity refers to the 29 surveys processed and analytic in that it analyzes “what is” rather than explaining causality or attempting predictive generalizations. A public repository with all the data related to the information capture process and the products resulting from the analysis of this information is publicly available. This study aims to strengthen the evidence and support practitioners in making better informed decisions about why companies are adopting edge computing and the current challenges they face. Additionally, the testing theory phase shows that the results are aligned with the ISO/IEC TR 30164 standard.;;10.1007/s00607-022-01104-2;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00607-022-01104-2;;;Edge Computing, IoT, Grounded Theory, Inter-rater Reliability, Inter-rater Agreement, 68-02, 68Qxx;Springer-Verlag;0010-485X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Mobile Collocated Gaming: Collaborative Play and Meaning-Making on a University Campus;Zhang, Xun and Gui, Xinning and Kou, Yubo and Li, Yukun;Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.;2020;ACM Digital Library;;4;Many mobile games are designed to be placeless, so that mobile device owners could play anytime, anywhere. But does such design erase the sense of place in mobile gaming? To investigate the spatiality of mobile gaming, we conducted an ethnographic study of mobile gaming in a Chinese university. We found mobile gaming as a form of collocated interaction, where participants collectively created meanings around distinctive places on the campus including dormitory, classroom, and laboratory, and engaged in collaborative play. Their mobile collocated gaming was shaped by the social, organizational, and cultural contexts of places. The spatiality of mobile collocated gaming entails both appropriation of the norms and expectations of places and creation of new meanings to negotiate tensions between mobile gaming and places. We further discuss the spatiality of mobile collocated gaming and broader social and cultural conditions.;;10.1145/3415213;https://doi.org/10.1145/3415213;;;china., mobile collocated gaming, mobile game, place, space, spatiality, university student;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Knowledge Diffusion of the Internet of Things (IoT): A Main Path Analysis;Rejeb, Abderahman and Rejeb, Karim and Zailani, Suhaiza Hanim Mohamad and Abdollahi, Alireza;Wirel. Pers. Commun.;2022;ACM Digital Library;1177–1207;126;The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that has attracted significant attention since the emergence of wireless technology. The knowledge diffusion of IoT takes place when an individual disseminates his knowledge of IoT to the persons to whom he is directly connected, and knowledge creation arises when the persons receive new knowledge of IoT, which is combined with their existing knowledge. In the current literature, several efforts have been devoted to summarising previous studies on IoT. However, the rapid development of IoT research necessitates examining the knowledge diffusion routes in the IoT domain by applying the main path analysis (MPA). It is crucial to update prior IoT studies and revisit the knowledge evolution and future research directions in this domain. Therefore, this paper adopts the keyword co-occurrence network and MPA to identify the research hotspots and study the historical development of the IoT domain based on 27,425 papers collected from the Web of Science from 1970 to 2020. The results show that IoT research is focused on IoT applications for smart cities, wireless networks, blockchain technology, computing technologies, and AI technologies. The findings from the MPA address the need to explore the knowledge evolution in the IoT domain. They also provide a valuable guide to disseminate the knowledge  of IoT among researchers and practitioners, assisting them to understand the history, present and future trends of IoT development and implementation.;;10.1007/s11277-022-09787-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11277-022-09787-8;;;Knowledge diffusion, Internet of Things, Co-occurrence cluster, Main path analysis;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0929-6212;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Negotiating Priorities on the Shopfloor: A Design Case Study of Maintainers’ Practices;"Kotthaus, Christoph and Vitt, Nico and Kr\""{u}ger, Max and Pipek, Volkmar and Wulf, Volker";Comput. Supported Coop. Work;2022;ACM Digital Library;141–210;32;The coordination of maintenance work in manufacturing poses a crucial productivity factor in small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) but often seems to be rather neglected in practice as well as in much of the literature on maintenance. We shed light upon maintenance coordination work by presenting a design case study conducted in an SME over approximately two years. We took a participatory design-oriented approach, involving all roles on the shopfloor affected by maintenance work. In three major iterations during the pre-study, a release-ready prototype was developed and implemented by the users over the course of one year. The evaluation of the tool showed how a new and mostly unintended practice of information flow, error reporting, and prioritization emerged such that, for instance, foremen becoming a central node of communication, formal prioritization shifting away from higher management, and actual prioritization being done by maintainers. This paper contributes to the body of CSCW work on maintenance practice in SMEs by presenting detailed empirical findings on the coordination work of maintainers, as well as the evaluation of socio-technical interventions into maintenance practices.;;10.1007/s10606-022-09444-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10606-022-09444-5;;;CSCW, Maintenance, Repair, Design case study, Qualitative research, Manufacturing;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0925-9724;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Collaborative approaches in sustainable and resilient manufacturing;Camarinha-Matos, Luis M. and Rocha, Andre Dionisio and Gra\c{c}a, Paula;J. Intell. Manuf.;2022;ACM Digital Library;499–519;35;In recent years, the manufacturing sector is going through a major transformation, as reflected in the concept of Industry 4.0 and digital transformation. The urge for such transformation is intensified when we consider the growing societal demands for sustainability. The notion of sustainable manufacturing has emerged as a result of this trend. Additionally, industries and the whole society face the challenges of an increasing number of disruptive events, either natural or human-caused, that can severely affect the normal operation of systems. Furthermore, the growing interconnectivity between organizations, people, and physical systems, supported by recent developments in information and communication technologies, highlights the important role that collaborative networks can play in the digital transformation processes. As such, this article analyses potential synergies between the areas of sustainable and resilient manufacturing and collaborative networks. The work also discusses how the responsibility for the various facets of sustainability can be distributed among the multiple entities involved in manufacturing. The study is based on a literature survey, complemented with the experience gained from various research projects and related initiatives in the area, and is organized according to various dimensions of Industry 4.0. A brief review of proposed approaches and indicators for measuring sustainability from the networked manufacturing perspective is also included. Finally, a set of key research challenges are identified to complement strategic research agendas in manufacturing.;;10.1007/s10845-022-02060-6;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-022-02060-6;;;Collaborative networks, Sustainable manufacturing, Resilience, Industry 4.0, Digital transformation, Industry 5.0, Sustainability indicators;Springer-Verlag;0956-5515;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Online rating system development using blockchain-based distributed ledger technology;Shaker, Monir and Shams Aliee, Fereidoon and Fotohi, Reza;Wirel. Netw.;2021;ACM Digital Library;1715–1737;27;In most websites, the online rating system provides the ratings of products and services to users. Lack of trust in data integrity and its manipulation has hindered fulfilling user satisfaction. Since existing online rating systems deal with a central server, all rating data is stored on the central server. Therefore, all rating data can be removed, modified, and manipulated by the system manager to change the ratings in favor of the service or product provider. In this paper, an online rating system using distributed ledger technologies has been presented as the proposed system to solve all the weaknesses of current systems. Distributed ledger technologies are completely decentralized and there is no centralization on them by any institution. Distributed ledger technologies have different variants. Among distributed ledger technologies, blockchain technology has been used in the proposed rating system because of its support for smart contracts. In the proposed online rating system, the Ethereum platform has been chosen from different blockchain platforms that have a public permission network. In this system, the raters cannot rate unless they submit a request to the system and be authorized to take part in the online product rating process. The important feature of the Ethereum platform is its support for smart contracts, which can be used to write the rating contract in the Solidity language. Also, using Proof of Authority consensus mechanisms, all rating transactions are approved by the surveyors. Since in the real Ethereum system, each rating transaction is sent to the network by the raters, some gas must be paid for each rating transaction. However, since this method is expensive, TestNet blockchain can be used in the rating system. Finally, the proposed rating system was used for rating the restaurants of a website and its features were tested.;;10.1007/s11276-020-02514-w;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11276-020-02514-w;;;Online rating system, Distributed ledger technology, Blockchain, Proof of authority (PoA) TestNe;Springer-Verlag;1022-0038;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Glob. Inf. Manage.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1–26;31;On-demand home service application (HSA) is a technological advancement that has brought various day-to-day services to our doorstep with just a few clicks. By using consumer-perceived values (utilitarian, hedonic, and social), trust transfer theory, and commitment-trust theory, the present study aims to investigate the factors influencing sharing intention and repurchase intention of consumers towards using HSAs on their mobile phones. This study involves collecting data from 357 respondents in India and analyzing the same using the SmartPLS 3 software. The results indicate that trust in HSA is influenced by utilitarian value and social value, but not by hedonic value. Trust in HSA results in repurchase intention, commitment, and sharing intention. Interestingly, trust in the user community affects sharing intention but not repurchase intention and commitment. The study integrates the consumer-perceived value, trust transfer theory, and commitment-trust theory to build an integrative framework that explains the consumers' sharing and repurchase intentions towards HSAs.;;10.4018/JGIM.326547;https://doi.org/10.4018/JGIM.326547;;;Commitment Trust Theory, Consumer-Perceived Value, Continuance Intention, Home Services Application, India, Sharing Intention, Trust Transfer Theory;IGI Global;1062-7375;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Flow with the Beat! Human-Centered Design of Virtual Environments for Musical Creativity Support in VR;Schlagowski, Ruben and Wildgrube, Fabian and Mertes, Silvan and George, Ceenu and Andr\'{e}, Elisabeth;;2022;ACM Digital Library;428–442;;As previous studies have shown, the environment of creative people can have a significant impact on their creative process and thus on their creations. However, with the advent of digital tools such as virtual instruments and digital audio workstations, more and more creative work is digital and decoupled from the creator’s environment. Virtual Reality technologies open up new possibilities here, as creative tools can seamlessly merge with any virtual environment the user finds himself in. This paper reports on the human-centered design process of a VR application that aims at supporting the user’s individual needs to support their creativity while composing percussive beats in virtual environments. For this purpose, we derived factors that influence creativity from literature and conducted focus group interviews in order to learn how virtual environments and 3DUI can be designed for creativity support. In a subsequent laboratory study, we let users interact with a virtual step sequencer UI in virtual environments that were either customizable or fixed/unchangeable. By analyzing post-test ratings from music experts, self-report questionnaires, and user behavior data, we examined the effects of such customizable virtual environments on user creativity, user experience, flow, and subjective creativity support scales. While we did not observe a significant impact of this independent variable on user creativity, user experience or flow, we found that users had specific individual needs regarding their virtual surroundings and strongly preferred customizable virtual environments, even though the fixed virtual environment was designed to be creatively stimulating. We also observed consistently high flow and user experience ratings, which promote human-centered design of VR-based creativity support tools in a musical context.;;10.1145/3527927.3532799;https://doi.org/10.1145/3527927.3532799;;;Creativity, Creativity Support Tools, Generative Adversarial Networks, Musical XR, User Centered Design, User Interface Design, Virtual Reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Using Networked Ontologies to support UX Evaluation in Immersive Context;Costa, Simone Dornelas and Manso, Carolina De Freitas and Marques, Leonardo Carneiro and Gadelha, Bruno Freitas and Conte, Tayana Uch\^{o}a and Barcellos, Monalessa Perini;;2024;ACM Digital Library;;;Over the past few years, new interactive systems such as immersive technologies have gradually permeated our daily lives and found adoption across various fields. Immersive technologies provide users with immersive experiences. Assessing and modeling the quality of such experiences has become a trending topic in HCI, and UX is a key quality attribute in this context. When it comes to immersive experiences, evaluating UX is particularly challenging because the user should not be interrupted to provide feedback. In this paper, we propose using networked ontologies to support evaluating immersive experiences. We have explored using ontologies from an ontology network addressing the HCI domain to develop a tool that supports UX experts evaluating such experiences based on data recorded in interaction logs. We used the ontology-based tool to evaluate the UX of an immersive application that supports collaborative music composition. The tool extracted data from the application interaction logs applied UX metrics, and provided consolidated data and information in graphs and tables. We conducted a study and collected feedback from the tool developer and three UX experts who used the tool. Results showed that using networked ontologies to develop a tool to support UX evaluation is feasible and valuable. In summary, the ontologies helped at the conceptual level by offering a basis to define the system’s structural model and at the implementation level by assigning semantics to data to make inferences about UX. Based on the UX experts’ perceptions, the tool was considered a promising system, beneficial, helpful, and easy to use.;;10.1145/3638067.3638080;https://doi.org/10.1145/3638067.3638080;;;Immersive Experience, Ontology, Ontology Network, UX Evaluation, User Experience;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Delaunay walk for fast nearest neighbor: accelerating correspondence matching for ICP;Anderson, James D. and Raettig, Ryan M. and Larson, Josh and Nykl, Scott L. and Taylor, Clark N. and Wischgoll, Thomas;Mach. Vision Appl.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;33;Point set registration algorithms such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) are commonly utilized in time-constrained environments like robotics. Finding the nearest neighbor of a point in a reference 3D point set is a common operation in ICP and frequently consumes at least 90% of the computation time. We introduce a novel approach to performing the distance-based nearest neighbor step based on Delaunay triangulation. This greedy algorithm finds the nearest neighbor of a query point by traversing the edges of the Delaunay triangulation created from a reference 3D point set. Our work integrates the Delaunay traversal into the correspondences search of ICP and exploits the iterative aspect of ICP by caching previous correspondences to expedite each iteration. An algorithmic analysis and comparison is conducted showing an order of magnitude speedup for both serial and vector processor implementation.;;10.1007/s00138-022-01279-w;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00138-022-01279-w;;;Nearest neighbor search, Delaunay triangulation, 3d point cloud processing, Point registration, Iterative Closest Point;Springer-Verlag;0932-8092;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Vision Appl.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;34;Real-time semantic segmentation is a challenging task as both segmentation accuracy and inference speed need to be considered at the same time. In this paper, a Dual Context Network (DCNet) is presented to address this challenge. It contains two independent sub-networks: Region Context Network and Pixel Context Network. Region Context Network is main network with low-resolution input and features re-weighting module to achieve sufficient receptive field. Meanwhile, Pixel Context Network with location attention module is to capture the location dependencies of each pixel for assisting the main network to recover spatial detail. A contextual feature fusion is introduced to combine output features of these two sub-networks. The experiments show that DCNet can achieve high-quality segmentation while keeping a high speed. Specifically, for Cityscapes test dataset, it can achieve 76.1% Mean IOU with the speed of 82 FPS on a single GTX 2080Ti GPU when using ResNet50 as backbone and 71.2% Mean IOU with the speed of 142 FPS when using ResNet18 as backbone.;;10.1007/s00138-023-01373-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00138-023-01373-7;;;Real-time, Semantic segmentation, Feature fusion, Context information, Location attention;Springer-Verlag;0932-8092;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Exploiting user reviews for automatic movie tagging;Wu, Canrui and Wang, Chen and Zhou, Yipeng and Wu, Di and Chen, Min and Wang, Jessie Hui and Qin, Jing;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2020;ACM Digital Library;11399–11419;79;Auto-tagging movies with apt keywords/tags is essential and indispensable for online video providers. Tagged keywords are beneficial for movie promotion and recommendation. Currently, a popular approach is to propagate tags between similar videos identified by checking image similarity, which in principle takes each video as a sequence of frames. This approach is applicable for short video clips, however it is inefficient in processing long videos such as commercial movies, because it is very rare for two commercial movies to share a large portion of similar frames even if they belong to the same genre. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to auto-tag movies with two major steps. In the first step, we only consider popular movies with tremendous amount of attentions from online users, and we tag them by extracting keywords from user reviews. In the second step, unpopular movies are tagged by propagating the tags of similar popular movies to them. The similarity is evaluated based on multiple quantified attributes, including the movie summary, the title, the country, the genre and the tags, instead of frames to avoid expensive computation cost. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we conduct experiments using data crawled from Douban, one of the largest movie rating websites in China. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme by significantly improving tagging performance (in terms of Precision, Recall and F-Score) in comparison to baseline schemes.;;10.1007/s11042-019-08513-0;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-019-08513-0;;;Auto-tagging, Movie tagging, Tag propagation;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Code replicability in computer graphics;Bonneel, Nicolas and Coeurjolly, David and Digne, Julie and Mellado, Nicolas;ACM Trans. Graph.;2020;ACM Digital Library;;39;"Being able to duplicate published research results is an important process of conducting research whether to build upon these findings or to compare with them. This process is called ""replicability"" when using the original authors' artifacts (e.g., code), or ""reproducibility"" otherwise (e.g., re-implementing algorithms). Reproducibility and replicability of research results have gained a lot of interest recently with assessment studies being led in various fields, and they are often seen as a trigger for better result diffusion and transparency. In this work, we assess replicability in Computer Graphics, by evaluating whether the code is available and whether it works properly. As a proxy for this field we compiled, ran and analyzed 151 codes out of 374 papers from 2014, 2016 and 2018 SIGGRAPH conferences. This analysis shows a clear increase in the number of papers with available and operational research codes with a dependency on the subfields, and indicates a correlation between code replicability and citation count. We further provide an interactive tool to explore our results and evaluation data.";;10.1145/3386569.3392413;https://doi.org/10.1145/3386569.3392413;;;code review, open source, replicability, reproducibility, siggraph;Association for Computing Machinery;0730-0301;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The Language of Engineering: Training a Domain-Specific Word Embedding Model for Engineering;BRAUN, DANIEL and KLYMENKO, OLEKSANDRA and SCHOPF, TIM and KAAN AKAN, YUSUF and MATTHES, FLORIAN;;2021;ACM Digital Library;8–12;;Since the introduction of Word2Vec in 2013, so-called word embeddings, dense vector representation of words that are supposed to capture their semantic meaning, have become a universally applied technique in a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and domains. The vector representations they provide are learned on huge corpora of unlabeled text data. Due to the large amount of data and computing power that is necessary to train such embedding models, very often, pre-trained models are applied which have been trained on domain unspecific data like newspaper articles or Wikipedia entries. In this paper, we present a domain-specific embedding model that is trained exclusively on texts from the domain of engineering. We will show that such a domain-specific embeddings model performs better in different NLP tasks and can therefore help to improve NLP-based AI in the domain of Engineering.;;10.1145/3460824.3460826;https://doi.org/10.1145/3460824.3460826;;;Engineering, Word Embeddings;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Usability Evaluation Techniques for Virtual Environments: An Exploratory Study;Castro, John W. and Madrigal, Gianina and Rojas, Luis A.;;2023;ACM Digital Library;450–465;;Virtual reality is a concept of specialized hardware that generates an experience with different levels of intensity and interactivity within environments in which users feel immersed in an apparently real world and is defined based on the technology. Currently, several fields, such as education and health, use virtual reality. Due to the wide range of users (children, youth, adults, and even older adults) who can interact with virtual environments, it is essential to consider the usability of this type of software system. The evaluation of usability is carried out through usability tests. Research on evaluating virtual environments’ usability is scattered in several scientific databases. To the best of our knowledge, no research work compiles and reports globally on which techniques are used to evaluate the usability of such software systems. We conducted a systematic mapping study to assess the general panorama of techniques related to usability evaluation that are being used in virtual environments. We identified a total of 30 primary studies. The main techniques for usability evaluation are interviews, heuristic evaluation, surveys, usability experiments and expert evaluation. Some of these techniques are being used together. In addition, we have identified some works that propose frameworks or methodologies for evaluating the usability of virtual reality systems.;;10.1007/978-3-031-35927-9_31;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-35927-9_31;;;Usability Evaluation, Virtual Environments, Exploratory Study;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;FPGA Design of Transposed Convolutions for Deep Learning Using High-Level Synthesis;Sestito, Cristian and Perri, Stefania and Stewart, Robert;J. Signal Process. Syst.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1245–1263;95;Deep Learning (DL) is pervasive across a wide variety of domains. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often used for image processing DL applications. Modern CNN models are growing to meet the needs of more sophisticated tasks, e.g. using Transposed Convolutions (TCONVs) for image decompression and image generation. Such state-of-the-art DL models often target GPU-based high-performance architectures, due to the high computational and hardware resource needs of TCONV layers. To avoid prohibitive GPU energy costs, CNNs are increasingly deployed to decentralized embedded autonomous devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, this poses challenges for designing efficient hardware implementations of TCONV layers. This paper presents a parameterized design and implementation of a new TCONV module, which is synthesizable onto FPGAs. It is implemented using the High-Level Synthesis (HLS), through a C++ template to parameterize its functional and non-functional properties. These parameters allow kernel sizes, image sizes, quantization and parallelism to be varied by users. With a systematic exploration in this design space, we find an optimal instance of this TCONV module that achieves 6.25 Giga Outputs per Second (Gout/s) using just 1.53 W of power. We then use our TCONV layer in two neural networks for image decompression and image generation. Image decompression achieves a speed throughput of more than 30K frames-per-second (fps) using only the 16% of resources on average, image generation achieves an energy efficiency of 324 fps/W and outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models by at least 7.3\texttimes{}.;;10.1007/s11265-023-01883-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11265-023-01883-7;;;Transposed Convolution, Deep Learning, FPGA, High-Level Synthesis, Quantization, Parallelism;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1939-8018;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Deep Learning with Graph Convolutional Networks: An Overview and Latest Applications in Computational Intelligence;Bhatti, Uzair Aslam and Tang, Hao and Wu, Guilu and Marjan, Shah and Hussain, Aamir and Sarker, Subrata Kumar;Int. J. Intell. Syst.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;2023;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received widespread attention due to their powerful modeling capabilities and have been successfully applied in natural language processing, image recognition, and other fields. On the other hand, traditional CNN can only deal with Euclidean spatial data. In contrast, many real-life scenarios, such as transportation networks, social networks, reference networks, and so on, exist in graph data. The creation of graph convolution operators and graph pooling is at the heart of migrating CNN to graph data analysis and processing. With the advancement of the Internet and technology, graph convolution network (GCN), as an innovative technology in artificial intelligence (AI), has received more and more attention. GCN has been widely used in different fields such as image processing, intelligent recommender system, knowledge-based graph, and other areas due to their excellent characteristics in processing non-European spatial data. At the same time, communication networks have also embraced AI technology in recent years, and AI serves as the brain of the future network and realizes the comprehensive intelligence of the future grid. Many complex communication network problems can be abstracted as graph-based optimization problems and solved by GCN, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. This survey briefly describes the definition of graph-based machine learning, introduces different types of graph networks, summarizes the application of GCN in various research fields, analyzes the research status, and gives the future research direction.;;10.1155/2023/8342104;https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/8342104;;;;John Wiley and Sons Ltd.;0884-8173;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;6;Despite the tremendous progress made for recognizing gestures acquired by various devices, such as the Leap Motion Controller, developing a gestural user interface based on such devices still induces a significant programming and software engineering effort before obtaining a running interactive application. To facilitate this development, we present QuantumLeap, a framework for engineering gestural user interfaces based on the Leap Motion Controller. Its pipeline software architecture can be parameterized to define a workflow among modules for acquiring gestures from the Leap Motion Controller, for segmenting them, recognizing them, and managing their mapping to functions of the application. To demonstrate its practical usage, we implement two gesture-based applications: an image viewer that allows healthcare workers to browse DICOM medical images of their patients without any hygiene issues commonly associated with touch user interfaces and a large-scale application for managing multimedia contents on wall screens. To evaluate the usability of QuantumLeap, seven participants took part in an experiment in which they used QuantumLeap to add a gestural interface to an existing application.;;10.1145/3532211;https://doi.org/10.1145/3532211;;;engineering gestural user interfaces, framework for interactive systems, gesture recognition, gesture-based interfaces, leap motion controller, mid-air gestural interaction, new datasets for engineering interactive systems, processes for engineering interactive systems, stroke gestures;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Privacy and Security in Mixed Reality Learning Environments by Input and User/Bot Interaction Protection;Tran, Lan Anh and Hensen, Benedikt and Klamma, Ralf and Chantaraskul, Soamsiri;;2022;ACM Digital Library;63–71;;Mixed reality is known as an advanced technology that provides a new approach for learning environments. Such environments allow learners to interact with both virtual and real worlds and bringing in potential enhancements to the learning process at the same time. For example, chatbots can facilitate the learning process. However, security and privacy settings for interacting with chatbots in such mixed reality environments are complex. In this paper, we introduce a mixed reality virtual assistant that is integrated into the collaborative environment of our existing application VIAProMa. This embodied chatbot allows lecturers and students to participate in mixed reality and online classrooms in real-time. The participants can interact with each other via VIAProMa’s avatar representations and can communicate with the chatbot that is represented by the mixed reality bot. The bot is realized by connecting a Slack chatbot with the mixed reality learning environment. It is displayed as an intuitive 3D model and is able to communicate with the users in spoken language. In this environment, privacy and security settings are conducted to protect the user input and user interaction with the bot. The evaluation results show that the system works stably with good performance. All the visualizations and features are well designed and were understood by the users. Users preferred the speech interface with the bot over a textual interface. The research has a strong impact on the design of security and privacy features for mixed reality environments in general.;;10.1145/3512353.3512363;https://doi.org/10.1145/3512353.3512363;;;collaboration, learning environment, mixed reality, social bots;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Robots;2023;ACM Digital Library;833–847;47;Many people are fascinated by biological swarms, but understanding the behavior and inherent task objectives of a bird flock or ant colony requires training. Whereas several swarm intelligence works focus on mimicking natural swarm behaviors, we argue that this may not be the most intuitive approach to facilitate communication with the operators. Instead, we focus on the legibility of swarm expressive motions to communicate mission-specific messages to the operator. To do so, we leverage swarm intelligence algorithms on chain formation for resilient exploration and mapping combined with acyclic graph formation (AGF) into a novel swarm-oriented programming strategy. We then explore how expressive motions of robot swarms could be designed and test the legibility of nine different expressive motions in an online user study with 98 participants. We found several differences between the motions in communicating messages to the users. These findings represent a promising starting point for the design of legible expressive motions for implementation in decentralized robot swarms.;;10.1007/s10514-022-10079-0;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-022-10079-0;;;Expressive motion, Robotic swarm, Exploration algorithms, Legibility, User study;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0929-5593;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Digital forensics framework for intent-based networking over software-defined networks;Hyder, Muhammad Faraz and Fatima, Tasbiha and Arshad, Saadia;Telecommun. Syst.;2023;ACM Digital Library;11–27;85;Intent-based networking (IBN) is an evolutionary paradigm. Its recent adaptation has been increased substantially by Cloud Service Providers, Telecom, and network operators due to its automation capabilities. However, there are certain challenges specifically related to security. One of the core challenges is the lack of a forensic framework for identifying different incidents inside IBN. In this paper, we have proposed a framework to perform the forensics investigation of an IBN inside a software defined networking (SDN) environment. This framework is based on the steps of the forensics investigation process and consists of four modules: Identification, Collection, Analysis, and Reporting. Identification includes logs searching for specific events. Logs are searched through keywords, Time, Date, and Event ID. Pieces of evidence are collected from the Application, Control, and Infrastructure Layers of SDN by exploiting the default log file of ONOS and third-party tools. The analysis is performed using manual analysis of the raw log entries and third-party tools such as Loki/Grafana. This framework is implemented by utilizing ONOS as an SDN controller. The emulator used for creating the experimental network is Mininet on two different use cases: Normal Traffic Routing and Redirection of Attack Traffic, to analyze the difference in log files generated by the SDN controller. These files are manually analyzed and sent to the Loki–Grafana server for better analysis, visualization, and real-time monitoring of IBN logs. Assessment of the obtained experimental results is based on the states defined in the Intent Framework of ONOS.;;10.1007/s11235-023-01064-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11235-023-01064-8;;;Distributed denial of service attacks, Intent-based networking, IBN forensics, Software defined networking, SDN forensics;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1018-4864;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A First Look at On-device Models in iOS Apps;Hu, Han and Huang, Yujin and Chen, Qiuyuan and Zhuo, Terry Yue and Chen, Chunyang;ACM Trans. Softw. Eng. Methodol.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;33;Powered by the rising popularity of deep learning techniques on smartphones, on-device deep learning models are being used in vital fields such as finance, social media, and driving assistance. Because of the transparency of the Android platform and the on-device models inside, on-device models on Android smartphones have been proven to be extremely vulnerable. However, due to the challenge in accessing and analyzing iOS app files, despite iOS being a mobile platform as popular as Android, there are no relevant works on on-device models in iOS apps. Since the functionalities of the same app on Android and iOS platforms are similar, the same vulnerabilities may exist on both platforms. In this article, we present the first empirical study about on-device models in iOS apps, including their adoption of deep learning frameworks, structure, functionality, and potential security issues. We study why current developers use different on-device models for one app between iOS and Android. We propose a more general attack against white-box models that does not rely on pre-trained models and a new adversarial attack approach based on our findings to target iOS’s gray-box on-device models. Our results show the effectiveness of our approaches. Finally, we successfully exploit the vulnerabilities of on-device models to attack real-world iOS apps.;;10.1145/3617177;https://doi.org/10.1145/3617177;;;On-device models, iOS, adversarial attack, mobile, iPhone;Association for Computing Machinery;1049-331X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Proxies to the monthly active user number of Geo AR Mobile games – online search volume as a proposal;Liu, Hugh Xuechen and Wagner, Christian;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2023;ACM Digital Library;25403–25425;82;Mobile game metrics have received attention since the emergence of big data technology and data-based decision-making. Among different metrics, the monthly active user number is usually significant because it shows the level of players’ engagement and the profit of this game as a business. Therefore, the monthly active user number is valuable for researchers, analysts, and decision-makers interested in the mobile game industry. However, the actual monthly active user number data typically have the accuracy, accessibility, granularity, and cost problems. Therefore, a proxy to the monthly active user number would be helpful to facilitate the decision-making process. This paper proposes to capture user activity through the searches on the Internet from an information-seeking perspective. And the online search volume, wiki page view, social media posts and views are proposed as potential proxies.

;Test Input Prioritization for 3D Point Clouds;Li, Yinghua and Dang, Xueqi and Ma, Lei and Klein, Jacques and Traon, Yves LE and Bissyand\'{e}, Tegawend\'{e} F.;ACM Trans. Softw. Eng. Methodol.;2024;ACM Digital Library;;;Three-dimensional (3D) point cloud applications have become increasingly prevalent in diverse domains, showcasing their efficacy in various software systems. However, testing such applications presents unique challenges due to the high-dimensional nature of 3D point cloud data and the vast number of possible test cases. Test input prioritization has emerged as a promising approach to enhance testing efficiency by prioritizing potentially misclassified test cases during the early stages of the testing process. Consequently, this enables the early labeling of critical inputs, leading to a reduction in the overall labeling cost. However, applying existing prioritization methods to 3D point cloud data is constrained by several factors: 1) Inadequate consideration of crucial spatial information, and 2) susceptibility to noises inherent in 3D point cloud data. In this paper, we propose PCPrior, the first test prioritization approach specifically designed for 3D point cloud test cases. The fundamental concept behind PCPrior is that test inputs closer to the decision boundary of the model are more likely to be predicted incorrectly. To capture the spatial relationship between a point cloud test and the decision boundary, we propose transforming each test (a point cloud) into a low-dimensional feature vector, towards indirectly revealing the underlying proximity between a test and the decision boundary. To achieve this, we carefully design a group of feature generation strategies, and for each test input, we generate four distinct types of features, namely, spatial features, mutation features, prediction features, and uncertainty features. Through a concatenation of the four feature types, PCPrior assembles a final feature vector for each test. Subsequently, a ranking model is employed to estimate the probability of misclassification for each test based on its feature vector. Finally, PCPrior ranks all tests based on their misclassification probabilities. We conducted an extensive study based on 165 subjects to evaluate the performance of PCPrior, encompassing both natural and noisy datasets. The results demonstrate that PCPrior outperforms all the compared test prioritization approaches, with an average improvement of 10.99%~66.94% on natural datasets and 16.62%~53% on noisy datasets.;;10.1145/3643676;https://doi.org/10.1145/3643676;;;Test Input Prioritization, Deep Neural Network, Learning to Rank, Labeling;Association for Computing Machinery;1049-331X;;Just Accepted;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Industry 4.0 Briefcase: An Innovative Engineering Outreach Project for Professions of the Future;Inceoglu, Mustafa M. and Ciloglugil, Birol;;2020;ACM Digital Library;979–988;;This paper presents an engineering outreach project titled “Industry 4.0 Briefcase” that has been developed to introduce the concept of Industry 4.0 to undergraduate students. The project aims to support participants to become aware of Industry 4.0 related topics such as machine learning, data mining, industrial automation, human-machine interface, and product life cycle, and to stimulate the curiosity of them towards these topics. The scope of the project consists of presentations, experimental applications, observations, individual and collaborative studies, assessment and evaluation practices, e-learning applications, and a social program. The project was conducted as a one- week program at a public university in Turkey with the participation of 18 undergraduate 3rd-year students. Participants consist of students from computer engineering and software engineering departments of the engineering faculties and the business department of the faculty of economics and administrative sciences. Thus, participants of the project had the opportunity to exchange information with students and faculty members from different academic backgrounds. The study utilized the mixed methods approach by performing both quantitative and qualitative measurements. To collect data, mini projects and project evaluation forms were used for quantitative measurements and daily virtual classroom sessions and a general evaluation session (focus group interview) were used for qualitative measurements. The success rates of the participants based on the evaluation of the reports they presented were obtained as 91% in data mining, 95% in industrial automation and human-machine interface, and 89% in machine learning course, respectively. It was observed that the overall satisfaction level of the participants from the project activities was over 95%. These findings were also supported by the qualitative findings as the students indicated their overall satisfaction from the organization of the project and stated that working in teams and attending the social program contributed to developing positive relationships with each other and increasing their success.;;10.1007/978-3-030-58802-1_70;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58802-1_70;;;Engineering education, Engineering outreach, Industry 4.0 concepts, Industrial automation;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Distance Teaching Experience of Campus-based Teachers at Times of Pandemic Confinement;Cheddad, Abbas and Nordahl, Christian;;2023;ACM Digital Library;64–69;;"Amidst the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, distance education, where the learning process is conducted online, has become the norm. Campus-based programs and courses have been redesigned in a timely manner which was a challenge for teachers not used to distance teaching. Students’ engagement and active participation become an issue; add to that the new emerging effects associated with this setup, such as the so-called “Zoom fatigue”, a term coined recently by some authors referring to one's exhaustion feeling that stems from the overuse of virtual meetings. In realising this problem, solutions were suggested in the literature to help trigger students’ engagement and enhance teachers’ experience in online teaching. This study analyses these effects along with our teachers’ experience in the new learning environment and concludes by devising some recommendations. To attain the above objectives, we conducted online interviews with six of our teachers, transcribed the content of the videos and then applied the inductive research approach to assess the results.";;10.1145/3582580.3582592;https://doi.org/10.1145/3582580.3582592;;;COVID-19, Distance learning, Pandemic, Teacher's experience;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Intelligent Predicting Method for Optimizing Remote Loading Efficiency in Edge Service Migration;Meng, Xianyu and Shao, Xun and Masui, Hiroshi and Lu, Wei;Mob. Netw. Appl.;2022;ACM Digital Library;2218–2231;27;In mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, enhancing the learning capabilities of edge nodes through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve the efficiency of dynamically allocating resources. For the scenario of edge service migration, various tasks in lightweight IoT devices are offloaded to edge nodes and the services on edge nodes are migrated adaptively to another available node nearer to the users while they move. To speed up network application loading during service migration, this paper proposes an intelligent trace-driven predicting approach (ITPA) that improves the efficiency of I/O scheduling and the hit ratio of caching when migrating services between resource-constrained edge nodes. First, based on the characteristics of sequential access to the binary codes of an application during its startup progress, the request loading list is generated by tracing key I/O requests at that phase. Then, an intelligent algorithm is designed to search and select the key I/O requests in the loading list. Finally, the efficiency of data acquisition is improved by implementing a prefetch strategy for the client side and a three-level caching strategy for the server side. Experimental results show that the ITPA reduces the service startup time during stateless migration.;;10.1007/s11036-022-02002-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11036-022-02002-9;;;Internet of things, Artificial intelligence, Mobile edge computing, Remote loading, Service migration;Springer-Verlag;1383-469X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Low-power Caching Strategy for Cloud-edge Collaboration;Zhang, Xinyu and Hu, Zhigang and Liang, Yang and Xiao, Hui and Xu, Aikun and Zheng, Meiguang and Sun, Chuan;J. Grid Comput.;2024;ACM Digital Library;;22;In the era of ubiquitous network devices, an exponential increase in content requests from user equipment (UE) calls for optimized caching strategies within a cloud-edge integration. This approach is critical to handling large numbers of requests. To enhance caching efficiency, federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) is widely used to adjust caching policies. Nonetheless, for improved adaptability in dynamic scenarios, FDRL generally demands extended and online deep training, incurring a notable energy overhead when contrasted with rule-based approaches. With the aim of achieving a harmony between caching efficiency and training energy expenditure, we integrate a content request latency model, a deep reinforcement learning model based on markov decision processes (MDP), and a two-stage training energy consumption model. Together, these components define a new average delay and training energy gain (ADTEG) challenge. To address this challenge, we put forth a innovative dynamic federated optimization strategy. This approach refines the pre-training phase through the use of cluster-based strategies and parameter transfer methodologies. The online training phase is improved through a dynamic federated framework and an adaptive local iteration count. The experimental findings affirm that our proposed methodology reduces the training energy outlay while maintaining caching efficacy.;;10.1007/s10723-023-09730-6;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10723-023-09730-6;;;Collaborative caching strategy, Delay and training energy gain, Dynamic federated optimization mechanism, Federated deep reinforcement learning, Training energy;Springer-Verlag;1570-7873;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

To provide an immersive experience, in this paper, we propose VRCoding, a Virtual Reality (VR)-based block coding system. VRCoding can teach computational thinking in an immersive Virtual Reality environment, exploiting passive haptics to improve interaction and give tactile feedback to the users. Passive haptics is obtained using simple physics placeholders, i.e., textured parallelepipeds, that are tracked in real-time, and aligned with the coding blocks in VR.  
The system is tested on a group of secondary school users, performing simple coding exercises with a standard monitor-based block coding environment and with the proposed VRCoding block language.

We argue that automation and adaptation could help users to focus on their work. However, the challenge is to correctly and promptly determine when to adapt what, as often the users’ intent is unclear. To assist software developers, we build a gaze-adaptive integrated development environment using the developers’ gaze as the source for learning appropriate adaptation. Beyond our experience of using gaze for an adaptive user interface, we also report first feedback from developers regarding the desirability of such a user interface, which indicated that adaptations for development tools need to strike a careful balance between automation and user control. Nonetheless, the developers see the value in a gaze-based adaptive user interface and how it could improve software development tools going forward.;;10.1145/3603555.3603571;https://doi.org/10.1145/3603555.3603571;;;adaptive UI, automation, eye tracking, gaze, human-computer interaction, integrated development environment, software engineering, tools;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

In addition, challenges such as security, energy consumption, storage space, bandwidth, lack of mobility support, and lack of location awareness have made this problem more challenging. Expanding applications such as online gaming, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), metaverse, e-health, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have brought up new paradigms for processing big data. Some of the paradigms that have emerged in the last decade are trying to alleviate cloud computing problems jointly. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Fog Computing (FC) are the most critical techniques that serve the IoT. One of the common points of the above paradigms is the offloading of IoT tasks.

It is challenging for a subject to navigate a large virtual environment designed in a limited physical space. External hardware support may be required to achieve such an act in a concise physical area without compromising navigation and virtual scene rendering quality. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to let a subject navigate a limitless virtual environment within a limited physical space with no additional external hardware support apart from the regular Head-Mounted-Device (HMD) itself. As part of our work, we developed a Virtual Art Gallery as a use-case to validate our algorithm.

;Gamified Project-Based Learning: A Systematic Review;Huang, Wendan and Li, Xiuhan and Shang, Junjie;;2022;ACM Digital Library;313–324;;With the continuous development of information technology and the comprehensive requirements for students’ capacity, project-based learning (PBL) and gamified learning have been receiving widespread attention. Some researchers have begun to explore the integration and complementarity of PBL and gamified learning, and have started to practice gamified PBL (GPBL) instructional models in various teaching fields. This study provides a systematic review of literature about GPBL in the past six years. This study finds that current research characteristics of GPBL showed some variability, and the application modes of GPBL can be divided into four types: applying structure gamification to PBL, applying content gamification to PBL, using systematic educational game software as the knowledge carrier, project base or task scenario in the project and using game-making as the main PBL activity. Most of the studies affirmed the positive effects of GPBL in enhancing students’ learning experiences and interests, subject knowledge and learning outcomes. Finally, several suggestions for future research arose from this review. Researchers need to explore the effects of GPBL by expanding its scope of inquiry on the one hand, and to establish a scientific evaluation system on the other, which will help promote the quality of learning activities and students’ reflection.;;10.1007/978-3-031-08939-8_27;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-08939-8_27;;;GPBL, Game making, Educational games, Game elements;Springer-Verlag;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;EEDOS: an energy-efficient and delay-aware offloading scheme based on device to device collaboration in mobile edge computing;Ranji, Ramtin and Mansoor, Ali Mohammed and Sani, Asmiza Abdul;Telecommun. Syst.;2020;ACM Digital Library;171–182;73;Device to device (D2D) communication and mobile edge computing (MEC) are two promising technologies in fifth generation (5G) cellular mobile communication. Besides MEC, a new task offloading technique attracts the attention as D2D collaboration. However, there is lack of integrated D2D and MEC framework to address the energy and delay costs in a joint approach. This work, proposes an energy efficient and delay-aware offloading scheme (EEDOS) based on D2D collaboration in MEC. In EEDOS, mobile devices can offload their task to the MEC or an idle mobile device in their proximity. The task execution and offloading to the MEC or an idle nearby device is formulated, and the optimization problem is defined. The whole process of allocating proper offloading destination is designed in the edge server. EEDOS, classifies offloading requests according to the deadline and energy constraint of requesting device. Then, it finds the proper offloading destination by utilising the maximum matching with minimum cost graph algorithm. Through simulation, we show that EEDOS achieves 95 percent of energy efficiency in comparison of no-offloading task execution and outperforms existing studies in term of energy efficiency with an improved delay in task execution. Moreover, EEDOS is capable of performing more successful task offloading and requires less edge server resources.;;10.1007/s11235-019-00595-3;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11235-019-00595-3;;;Energy efficiency, Mobile edge computing, Device to device communication, Task offloading;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1018-4864;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The purpose of this research is to analyze the practice of STEM doctoral studies from the student-centered perspective by examining a case practice from a doctoral educational event. The paper deals with the questions whether the aims and expectations of graduate students are consistent with the goals and requirements of academics (researchers and teaching staff of higher education) and to what extent; what aspects of academic policy and pedagogical approaches correspond to the needs and requirements of the non-academic and innovative industries; and how the students understand their career prospects in terms of innovation, future job requirements, and knowledge-based entrepreneurship requests. In order to address this problem, a case study was conducted in four dimensions: academia, pedagogy, industry and entrepreneurship. As a result, a qualitative study provided several implications for organizations preparing future researchers and employees. The results show which students’ needs, challenges and problems and relevant requirements for academic institutions are related to the prospects of STEM education with an emphasis on computing (computer science) and software engineering as an integrating part.";;10.1007/978-3-030-63212-0_18;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63212-0_18;;;Student-centered education, Doctoral education, STEM education;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The Bigger Picture of Digital Interventions for Pain, Anxiety and Stress: A Systematic Review of 1200+ Controlled Trials;Khalili-Mahani, Najmeh and Tran, Sylvain;;2022;ACM Digital Library;67–78;;The aim of this systematic scoping review was to gain a better understanding of research trends in digital mental health care. We focused on comorbid conditions: depression, anxiety, and pain–which continue to affect an estimated 20% of world population and require complex and continuous social and medical care provisions. We searched all randomized controlled trials on PubMed until May 2021 for any articles that used a form of information and communication technology (ICT) in relation to primary outcomes anxiety, pain, depression, or stress. From 1285 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria, 890 were randomized trials with nearly 70% satisfactory outcomes. For depression and anxiety, the most frequently reported, were web-based, or mobile apps used for self-monitoring, and guided interventions. For pain, VR-based interventions or games were more prevalent, especially as tools for distraction, or as stimuli for mechanistic studies of pain or anxiety. We discuss gaps in knowledge and challenges that relate to the human factors in digital health applications, and underline the need for a practical and conceptual framework for capturing and reporting such variations.;;10.1007/978-3-031-06018-2_5;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06018-2_5;;;mHealth, Depression, Pain, Anxiety, Stress, Mental health, Digital health, Self-help, Therapy, Randomized controlled trials, Game, VR, ICT;Springer-Verlag;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Agent-Based Simulators for Empowering Patients in Self-Care Programs Using Mobile Agents with Machine Learning;Kumar, Swarn Avinash and Garc\'{\i}a-Magari\~{n}o, Iv\'{a}n and Nasralla, Moustafa M. and Nazir, Shah and Ali, Sikandar;Mob. Inf. Syst.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;2021;E-health sustainable systems can be optimized by empowering patients in self-care programs through artificial intelligence ecosystems in which both doctors and patients interact in an agile way. This work proposes agent-based simulators as a mechanism for predicting the repercussions of certain self-care programs in certain patients for finding the most appropriate ones. In order to make this easy for both doctors and patients, mobile agents are used to configure an app for each patient, and this app provides the resources to each self-care program. Mobile agents include a machine-learning module for learning which programs are the most appropriate for each patient. This approach is illustrated with two agent-based simulators for respectively reducing negative emotions such as depression and controlling heart rate variability extreme values related to stress. The resulting app was evaluated with a group of users with the Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of use (USE) scale and obtained 73% in usefulness, 77% in satisfaction, and 68% in ease of use.

;Development of a Virtual Reality Treatment for Tinnitus - A User Study;Draper, Corban and Cheung, Joe Ee and Wuensche, Burkhard and Sanders, Philip J.;;2023;ACM Digital Library;160–169;;Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no external sound source exists. There is currently no cure for tinnitus. Existing treatments aim to mitigate tinnitus through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Sound Therapy. Virtual Reality (VR) has been adopted in certain medical fields due to its ability to combine visual and audial stimuli, and create immersive, controlled environments. The purpose of this research was to develop a novel tinnitus treatment, combining VR with existing tinnitus sound therapy, and assess its usability. A user study with 18 healthy participants was conducted. Quantitative and qualitative analyses garnered largely positive results. Participants found the application enjoyable, relaxing, and not stressful. The combination of audial and visual elements inside the virtual environment delivered a unified audio-visual stimulus and a sense of control of the location of the auditory stimulus that would serve as a masker sound in future tinnitus masking paradigms. More elaborate environments (beach and forest) were perceived as more enjoyable and realistic than a scene with minimal content for functionality. The beach scene was perceived as the most relaxing set-up, but the forest scene was preferred overall. Our results suggest the VR application can be developed into a multisensory tinnitus treatment and that future testing of the application in a sample of patients with bothersome tinnitus is justified. We provide guidelines for future researchers looking to create their own VR tinnitus tools.;;10.1145/3579375.3579396;https://doi.org/10.1145/3579375.3579396;;;digital therapeutic, masking, multisensory integration, tinnitus, ventriloquist effect, virtual reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Self-supervised monocular depth estimation via two mechanisms of attention-aware cost volume;Hong, Zhongcheng and Wu, Qiuxia;Vis. Comput.;2022;ACM Digital Library;5937–5951;39;Self-supervised monocular depth estimation takes advantage of adjacent frame images as supervision signals for training, which has made a significant improvement in recovering holistic scene geometry. However, owing to these methods do not pay attention to the details of images, and the predicted depth maps are imprecise, where some small objects are neglected, object boundaries are blurred, as well as the predictions lack global consistency. Inspired by the excellent ability of the attention scheme to focus on details, we address these issues by using multi-frames to construct 3D cost volume and taking into account attention awareness for the cost volume so that the network is more inclined to learn important information from the cost volume. In this paper, we propose two mechanisms of attention-aware cost volume: voxel-wise attention-aware (VAA) network and recurrent attention-aware (RAA) network. For the VAA network, 3D convolution is exploited to reweight the 3D cost volume so as to enhance essential areas of the cost volume while suppressing unimportant areas. Therefore, our proposed VAA network can autonomously select the required details. For the RAA network, 3D cost volume is sequentially refined along the depth dimension with 2D convolutions, thereby expanding the receptive field in the depth range and achieving better global consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform other self-supervised methods on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets.;;10.1007/s00371-022-02704-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-022-02704-x;;;Depth estimation, Attention mechanism, Self-supervised learning, Cost volume;Springer-Verlag;0178-2789;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This paper describes an AR-based edugame designed to improve learning the geography curriculum in Greek elementary schools. The game utilizes two interaction techniques: via a virtual hand model and via a touch screen. Moreover, 3D objects represent prefectures and geographic regions to provide a more extensive presentation of a map. The game is a puzzle-like game with an additional phase of matching names to the puzzle pieces. Players move the 3D objects to complete the puzzle and choose provinces to continue the game by locating counties.

;Caveats in Eliciting Mobile App Requirements;Patkar, Nitish and Ghafari, Mohammad and Nierstrasz, Oscar and Hotomski, Sofija;;2020;ACM Digital Library;180–189;;Factors such as app stores or platform choices heavily affect functional and non-functional mobile app requirements. We surveyed 45 companies and interviewed ten experts to explore how factors that impact mobile app requirements are understood by requirements engineers in the mobile app industry.We observed the lack of knowledge in several areas. For instance, we observed that all practitioners were aware of data privacy concerns, however, they did not know that certain third-party libraries, usage aggregators, or advertising libraries also occasionally leak sensitive user data. Similarly, certain functional requirements may not be implementable in the absence of a third-party library that is either banned from an app store for policy violations or lacks features, for instance, missing desired features in ARKit library for iOS made practitioners turn to Android.We conclude that requirements engineers should have adequate technical experience with mobile app development as well as sufficient knowledge in areas such as privacy, security and law, in order to make informed decisions during requirements elicitation.;;10.1145/3383219.3383238;https://doi.org/10.1145/3383219.3383238;;;requirements engineering, requirements elicitation, Mobile app development;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Yet, agility is one of the prominent concepts in the organizational capability to gain competitive advantage in the global conditions that emerge with industry 4.0. However, a successful implementation of AI depends also on the ability to identify critical success factors (CSFs) that are important to be considered when implementing AI. While previous literature has already revealed CSFs that are important to be considered, this paper is the first of its kind that has used the M-TISM (Modified Total Interpretative Structural Modelling) methodology for the identification and prioritization of CSFs of AI in an agile industry 4.0 firm.

;Mobile learning: research context, methodologies and future works towards middle-aged adults – a systematic literature review;Mohtar, Syahida and Jomhari, Nazean and Mustafa, Mumtaz Begum and Yusoff, Zulkifli Mohd;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2022;ACM Digital Library;11117–11143;82;Over the past several years, mobile learning concepts have changed the way people perceived on mobile devices and technology in the learning environment. In earlier days, mobile devices were used mainly for communication purposes. Later, with many new advanced features of mobile devices, they have opened the opportunity for individuals to use them as mediated technology in learning. The traditional way of teaching and learning has shifted into a new learning dimension, where an individual can execute learning and teaching everywhere and anytime. Mobile learning has encouraged lifelong learning, in which everyone can have the opportunity to use mobile learning applications to gain knowledge. However, many of the previous studies on mobile learning have focused on the young and older adults, and less intention on middle-aged adults. In this research, it is targeted for the middle-aged adults which are described as those who are between the ages of 40 to 60. Middle-aged adults typically lead very active lives while at the same time are also very engaged in self-development programs aimed at enhancing their spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being. In this paper, we investigate the methodology used by researchers based on the research context namely, acceptance, adoption, effectiveness, impact, intention of use, readiness, and usability of mobile learning. The research context was coded to the identified methodologies found in the literature. This will help one to understand how mobile learning can be effectively implemented for middle-aged adults in future work. A systematic review was performed using EBSCO Discovery Service, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, IEEE and ACM databases to identify articles related to mobile learning adoption. A total of 65 journal articles were selected from the years 2016 to 2021 based on Kitchenham systematic review methodology. The result shows there is a need to strengthen research in the field of mobile learning with middle-aged adults.;;10.1007/s11042-022-13698-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13698-y;;;Methodology, Middle-aged adults, Self-directed learning, Mobile application;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Critical research trends of mobile technology-supported English language learning: A review of the top 100 highly cited articles;Elaish, Monther M. and Hussein, Mahmood H and Hwang, Gwo-Jen;Education and Information Technologies;2022;ACM Digital Library;4849–4874;28;Around the world, the number of English speakers and the significance of the English language are constantly increasing. Among various technology-supported instructional styles, Mobile Learning (M-Learning) has been recognized as a promising approach to enhance students’ competencies and skills in the English language. By examining previous literature, a number of reviews have been performed to investigate the role of M-learning in the English language. However, none of these studies has highlighted the trends, opportunities, and challenges identified in the most cited articles that focused solely on the English language. Therefore, to address these limitations, this study performed a review of the top 100 most cited articles, published between 2007 and 2020, indexed by the Web of Science, and addressing the English language only. The results revealed that most research in Mobile English Language Learning (M-ELL) followed an experimental design and employed a single mobile learning implementation. Additionally, the current study identified a number of research areas that require additional research attention. For example, further research is needed among students learning from home, more qualitative research is needed, and additional research is required to improve students’ higher-order thinking skills. The outcomes of this study provide a reference to researchers and educators who intend to use mobile technologies in the area of language education, especially in the context of the English language.;;10.1007/s10639-022-11352-6;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-11352-6;;;M-ELL, Pedagogical issues, Teaching/learning strategies, Applications in subject areas, Mobile learning;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1360-2357;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Despite the importance of both skills in the reading comprehension and overall learning, a limited number of studies have been found. These include seven studies on language comprehension and seven studies on decoding. The shortlisted studies were analysed and a very limited number of modalities were found to have been used; text, graphics, audio, video, and mouse movement are used in all the studies and are termed basic modalities. Statistical analysis was also conducted on three parameters: (1) outcome of the study; (2) generalisation; and (3) maintenance. The analysis showed that CBIs were effective in facilitating these children’s learning; there was a significant improvement in the performance of children from the baseline to during and the post-intervention period. The analysis of generalisation has revealed positive results, indicating that the children were able to transfer information to a different setting or situation. Positive results are also noted from the analysis of maintenance, which indicate that the children retained information following the withdrawal of intervention. The combination of teachers’ instructions and CBI has provided better results than using either of them separately.

Among them, the tourism industry is one of the activities that depend on the online interaction of users as a promotion and marketing strategy. Recommender systems have gained great importance as an engine to promote visits to tourist sites according to certain user preferences. This study proposes a hybrid development model that addresses software that provides information about tourist sites, cultural and historical interest of any city. The hybrid methodology is based on the classic waterfall model and the agile Scrum and Kanban methodologies, which allows incorporating the linear sequential scheme, but with the advantages of agile methodologies. The hybrid methodology was applied to the analysis and planning phase of the tourist recommendation software case study. Different functionalities were proposed aimed at providing information on the most important aspects for tourists. The proposed model maintains the cascading sequential structure, taking organizational and methodological aspects of the Scrum and Kanban proposal.

;How Developers Optimize Virtual Reality Applications: A Study of Optimization Commits in Open Source Unity Projects;Nusrat, Fariha and Hassan, Foyzul and Zhong, Hao and Wang, Xiaoyin;;2021;ACM Digital Library;473–485;;"Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technique that provides immersive experience for users. Due to the high computation cost of rendering real-time animation twice (for both eyes) and the resource limitation of wearable devices, VR applications often face performance bottlenecks and performance optimization plays an important role in VR software development. Performance optimizations of VR applications can be very different from those in traditional software as VR involves more elements such as graphics rendering and real-time animation. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on 183 real-world performance optimizations from 45 VR software projects. In particular, we manually categorized the optimizations into 11 categories, and applied static analysis to identify how they affect different life-cycle phases of VR applications. Furthermore, we studied the complexity and design / behavior effects of performance optimizations, and how optimizations are different between large organizational software projects and smaller personal software projects. Our major findings include: (1) graphics simplification (24.0%), rendering optimization (16.9%), language / API optimization (15.3%), heap avoidance (14.8%), and value caching (12.0%) are the most common categories of performance optimization in VR applications; (2) game logic updates (30.4%) and before-scene initialization (20.0%) are the most common life-cycle phases affected by performance issues; (3) 45.9% of the optimizations have behavior and design effects and 39.3% of the optimizations are systematic changes; (4) the distributions of optimization classes are very different between organizational VR projects and personal VR projects.";;10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00052;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00052;;;Virtual Reality, Performance Optimization, Empirical Study;IEEE Press;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Analytics Mistakes that Derail Software Startups;Rafiq, Usman and Melegati, Jorge and Khanna, Dron and Guerra, Eduardo and Wang, Xiaofeng;;2021;ACM Digital Library;60–69;;[Context] Software startups are engines of innovation and economy, yet building software startups is challenging and subject to a high failure rate. They need to act and respond fast in highly uncertain business environments. To do so, they need to identify crucial and actionable information that supports them in making correct decisions and reduce uncertainty. So far, the software startup literature focused predominantly on what information to measure from a metrics perspective. Thus, there is a lack of research investigating how to deal with information from an analytics perspective. [Objective] The current study aims at understanding how software startups are dealing with crucial information that could lead to meaningful actions. The overall research question that guides the study is: what analytics mistakes do software startups make? [Method] We investigated 22 failed software startups using their post-mortem reports as the main source. They were included in the study because the founding teams made mistakes related to information and analytics, which contributed to their startup failure to various degrees. We analyzed the collected data using thematic analysis. [Results] Ten types of mistakes made by the 22 failed startups when dealing with information are identified. These ten types are further grouped into four categories from an analytics process perspective, including information collection, information analysis, information communication, and information usage. [Conclusions] Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how software startups are dealing with information. It provides an opportunity for software startup teams to learn from the recurring mistakes of failed startups. Interesting future research avenues include defining patterns and antipatterns in software startup analytics by studying both failed and successful startups and doing an in-depth investigation of essential metrics for software startups.;;10.1145/3463274.3463305;https://doi.org/10.1145/3463274.3463305;;;startup analytics, software startups, information dealing mistakes, analytics mistakes;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Enabling end-users to implement larger block-based programs;Ritschel, Nico and Fronchetti, Felipe and Holmes, Reid and Garcia, Ronald and Shepherd, David C.;;2022;ACM Digital Library;347–349;;Block-based programming, already popular in computer science education, has been successfully used to make programming accessible to end-users in applied domains such as the field of robotics. Most prior work in these domains has examined smaller programs that are usually simple and fit a single screen. However, real block-based programs often grow larger and, because end-users are unlikely to break them down into separate functions, they often become unwieldy. In our study, we introduce a function-centric block-based environment to help end-users write programs that require a large number of blocks. Through a user study with 92 users, we evaluated our approach and found that while users could successfully complete smaller tasks with and without our approach, they were both quicker and more successful with our function-centric method when tackling larger tasks. This work demonstrates that adding scaffolding can encourage the systematic use of functions, enabling end-users to write larger programs with block-based programming environments, which can contribute to the solution of more complex tasks in applied domains.;;10.1145/3510454.3528644;https://doi.org/10.1145/3510454.3528644;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

However, the computational costs of these methods are often very huge, especially for transformer-based models. In this work, we propose ConvPose, an efficient human pose estimation model based on convolutional neural network architecture. ConvPose uses an efficient single branch structure, using the ConvNeXt Block as a baseline and incorporating the Coordinate Attention module. This composition not only provides better feature extraction capabilities, but also can efficiently obtain the global dependency relationships between human keypoints and scenes. The effective combination of the large convolution kernel and the attention module gives our model the ability to focus more on detailed features when oriented to complex scenes. In addition, the number of parameters and GFLOPs of our model are at a lighter level compared to current high- performance models, which offers more possibilities for deployment of the model in low-end devices. Experiments show that our model achieves 73.6AP on the MS-COCO dataset with only 6.3M parameters, which is a very competitive result.;;10.1145/3569966.3569989;https://doi.org/10.1145/3569966.3569989;;;convolutional neural network, Human pose estimation, Coordinate Attention, ConvNeXt;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Eng. Notes;2020;ACM Digital Library;14–17;45;The 2018 2nd International Workshop on Context-aware, Autonomous and Smart Architectures (CASA 2018) was held in conjunction with the 12th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2018), on September, 24th, 2018 in Madrid, Spain. The main topic of the workshop concerned the design of software architectures for dynamic, autonomous, and adaptive context-aware smart systems. Such systems address changes and cope with uncertainties at runtime. Therefore, the software architecture of such system should ensure the basis for their dynamicity, adaptivity, and autonomy. These basis should be solid because they represent the backbone of a system, and in the same time flexible because they address dynamicity during execution. The one-day workshop aimed to bring together researchers and practitioners from the academic and the industrial world to share and discuss their approaches, solutions, methodologies, ideas, and open questions about the software architecture design for context-aware, autonomous, and smart systems. The workshop enabled discussions and put the basis for future collaborations among the participants.;;10.1145/3375572.3375576;https://doi.org/10.1145/3375572.3375576;;;software architecture, smart, adaptation, self-management, context-aware, autonomous;Association for Computing Machinery;0163-5948;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Refactorings can be applied at different levels of granularity to resolve 'bad smells' that can be identified in various artifacts (e.g., methods, classes, packages). A fundamental software engineering principle that can be applied at various levels of granularity is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), whose violation leads to the creation of lengthy, complex and non-cohesive artifacts; incurring smells like Long Method, God Class, and Large Package. Such artifacts, apart from being large in size tend to implement more than one functionalities, leading to decreased cohesion, and increased coupling. In this paper, we study the effect of applying refactorings that lead to conformance to the SRP, at all three levels of granularity to identify possible differences between them. To study these differences, we performed an industrial case study on two large-scale software systems (more than 1,500 classes). Since SRP is by definition related to modularity, as a success measure for the refactoring we use coupling and cohesion metrics. The results of the study can prove beneficial for both researchers and practitioners, since various implications can be drawn.";;10.1145/3319008.3320125;https://doi.org/10.1145/3319008.3320125;;;software metrics, modularity, industrial case study, Refactorings;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45358;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The accessibility of the learning resources needs to be available from anywhere anytime despite having strong or poor internet connection. It has motivated researchers to imply context-aware capability in improving the accessibility of the learning resources. This paper presents a development process of Mudahnya BM mobile application that follows a fundamental concept of Mobile Cloud Learning (MCL). Mudahnya BM is an application to learn basic Malay language for learner 7–12&nbsp;years old. The injection of extrinsic and intrinsic context-aware help the application to improve the reasoning process for finding available learning resources from service providers. Semantic-based approach is applied in the reasoning process. This study involved the end users for evaluation purposes. 33 randomized scenarios have been tested using One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.

;Implement Deep Learning Networks with Transfer Learning to Develop Energy-friendly Applications Supporting Sustainability on Image-based Plant Disease Classification;Hu, Yihang and Wang, Zhuoran and Zhu, Li and Zhang, Wenyu;;2023;ACM Digital Library;58–70;;"Food security is always one of the most important factors in human lives, and crop diseases are one of the major threats which may bring potential damage. Nowadays, with the proliferation of smartphones and the advancement of machine learning methods, it is more likely to achieve rapid identification of disease diagnosis by a smartphone-assisted application supported by deep learning trained models. By comparing different datasets and different kinds of CNN frameworks, this paper trained deep convolutional neural networks based on plant leaves’ images to identify species and detect diseases. Furthermore, this paper found the best combination of different datasets with the highest accuracy. The highest accuracy this work got is 97.37%, using ResNet-9 along with Transfer Learning. Nevertheless, these training datasets are too straightforward to deal with the more complex real-world situation. Besides, two-dimensional datasets from time to time have such limited information; therefore, more information is needed to diagnose plants’ diseases. For future extension, this work can apply not only image datasets but also environmental factors, such as soil structure and image background, to construct a more precise model to diagnose plant diseases. Hence, the concept of Point Cloud will be discussed in this paper. This work can be viewed as the first step to build an Energy-friendly plant disease classification application supporting sustainability.";;10.1145/3582084.3582095;https://doi.org/10.1145/3582084.3582095;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Walking Down the Road to Independent Mobility: An Adaptive Route Training System for the Cognitively Impaired;"Rink, Konstantin and Gruschka, Tristan and Palsbr\""{o}ker, Patrick and Baez, Marcos and Becking, Dominic and Seelmeyer, Udo and Dobslaw, Gudrun and Stolz, Patricia";;2023;ACM Digital Library;108–119;;In this paper we describe the design and development of a route training system for individuals with cognitive impairments (CIs) living in residential care facilities. Learning to move autonomously in public spaces is a fundamental skill for people with CI, who face several challenges to independently and safely move around. Yet, exploring opportunities for route training support, especially in residential settings, has received very little attention. To explore these opportunities, we followed a design and development process based on inclusive design practices that considered the organisational context and aimed at involving people with CI in the software design. To ensure our solution addressed the identified needs and abilities of this heterogeneous population, we further framed the route training definition as a design process that is enacted by the system, making the trainer and user co-creators of a personalised training. In this paper we report on the needs and challenges for mobility training in residential settings, introduce the design and formative evaluation of the route training system, to conclude with reflections and considerations on our methodological approach.Learning to navigate public spaces without assistance is important for people with cognitive impairments (CIs). It can help them overcome challenges to independently and safely reach places in their daily lives. Yet, the use of technology for route learning has not been fully explored in research, especially for people with CIs living in residential care. In this article, we describe the process of developing a route training system that explores the use of technology support. In our research, we tried different ways to involve people with CIs in the design of the system, which is seen as a more inclusive approach to designing solutions. We identified that people with CIs have different needs and abilities when it comes to route learning and related skills. For this reason, our solution focuses on ways to personalise the training, making sure people with CIs are involved in the personalisation, so that it fits their needs, abilities and learning progress.;;10.1109/ICSE-SEIS58686.2023.00016;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-SEIS58686.2023.00016;;;inclusive design, cognitive impairments, route training;IEEE Press;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A Conceptual Framework for Maturity Evaluation of BIM-Based AR/VR Systems Based on ISO Standards;Monla, Ziad and Assila, Ahlem and Beladjine, Djaoued and Zghal, Mourad;;2023;ACM Digital Library;139–156;;Maturity evaluation of BIM-based Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) systems is a challenging issue that requires ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. However, the lack of appropriate evaluation methods, tools, and standards for these systems makes this task even more complex. In this context, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for evaluating the maturity of BIM-based AR/VR systems, by using ISO standards. It represents a first and important step towards developing a standardized maturity model for such systems. The proposed framework enables the identification of fundamental concepts related to the evaluation of BIM-based AR and/or VR systems’ maturity. This ranges from identifying the evaluation goals to interpreting the final findings to identify mechanisms to evaluate outcomes. This framework is based on ISO/IEC TS 33061 standard for determining maturity levels and ISO/IEC 15939 for identifying measurement concepts. Evaluation can be performed either globally or in a customized way. The global evaluation considers all aspects of the system, while customized evaluation allows users to select specific key elements according to their requirements. A feasibility study, conducted by academic experts in the field, has been carried out in order to validate the proposed framework.;;10.1007/978-3-031-43401-3_9;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43401-3_9;;;Maturity, Evaluation, BIM-based AR, BIM-based VR, ISO standards;Springer-Verlag;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Trends and Challenges of Project-Based Learning in Computer Science and Engineering Education;Rehman, Sadaqat Ur;;2024;ACM Digital Library;397–403;;In computer science and engineering (CSE) education, project-based learning (PBL) has become a highly effective pedagogical strategy for encouraging students' teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving abilities in the real world. The current trends and difficulties with PBL implementation in computer science and engineering courses are thoroughly examined in this research. Within the context of computer science and engineering education, the evolution and integration of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is thoroughly analyzed. Emphasis is placed on its numerous advantages such as enhanced critical thinking, elevated student engagement, and the development of essential practical skills beneficial for a successful career in the field. Thus, a number of trends—including the growing demand for industry-relevant skills, the shift towards interdisciplinary collaboration, and the growing significance of open-source contributions in academic and professional settings—have an impact on the adoption of PBL. Consideration is also given to how technology, like virtual and augmented reality, bolsters immersive and group PBL experiences. However, a number of obstacles prevent the widespread adoption and successful application of PBL. These challenges include faculty reluctance because a change in conventional teaching methods is necessary, a lack of infrastructure and resources, difficulties with assessment and evaluation, and the potential for an unequal distribution of effort among students. With an emphasis on faculty development, resource allocation, and the creation of efficient evaluation strategies, I offer solutions to these issues. Finally, I discuss PBL's future directions in computer science and engineering education, highlighting the need for ongoing development and adjustment to the always-changing technological environment. At the same time that I acknowledge the persistent difficulties that educators and institutions continue to face, I also emphasize the value of PBL in preparing students for the dynamic and challenging nature of computer science and engineering education.;;10.1145/3629296.3629360;https://doi.org/10.1145/3629296.3629360;;;Challenges and Trends in Education, Computer Science Education, Project Based Learning;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45442;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The Balance of Attention: The Challenges of Creating Locative Cultural Storytelling Experiences;Millard, David E. and Packer, Heather and Howard, Yvonne and Hargood, Charlie;J. Comput. Cult. Herit.;2020;ACM Digital Library;;13;There is a long history of research exploring how augmented and mixed reality systems can be used to support visitors to cultural heritage locations, but the technological or application specific focus of much of this research means that our understanding of how these experiences work is more of a collection of insights, rather than a coherent theory about how the elements of the experience come together. There is a danger that without developing this knowledge further, our systems will be technologically complex, but experientially simplistic. In this article, we explore how one form of mixed reality experience, digital locative storytelling, can impact the experience of place, and in turn how place impacts the experience of story. We have analyzed 33 interviews, and 25 participant observations from 12 story deployments at 2 different sites. Our findings confirm that locative storytelling experiences not only impart information to readers, but also help them to rediscover familiar places and see hidden relationships—especially through time. But our findings also show how the success of the experience is reliant on the balance of attention between the virtual and real (the story and the place), and that issues with navigation, social interactions, and technology are problematic because they can disrupt this balance. Digital locative experiences therefore need to be designed carefully in order to create a balance of attention (e.g., by aligning the elements of the story with the topology and character of place). We call this a state of Loco-Narrative Harmony, in which place and story are working together and reader attention is balanced, creating an effect that is greater than the sum of its parts.;;10.1145/3404195;https://doi.org/10.1145/3404195;;;mixed reality, digital visitor experiences, augmented reality, Locative literature;Association for Computing Machinery;1556-4673;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Grid Comput.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;20;Globally, cities are emerging into Smart Cities (SC) as a result of sustainable cities and the adaption of recent Internet of Things (IoT) technology. It is becoming essential to involve students in sustainability as engineering and technology are crucial elements in fixing the past adverse effects on our globe. Engineering e-learners are being educated on the sustainable development of SC in many Smart e-learning Tools (SeT) and infrastructure faculties around the world, especially in developing Asian countries such as India. This research paper presents an advanced solution for interactive Smart Learning Environment (SLE) systems based on new IoT technologies in the Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) found in Smart Learning Environments (SLE) for SC people. The proposed IoT-Ve-LS system provides an optimized solution for online classes to attend classes using VR/AR glasses to feel the interactions between Smart Digital Devices (SDD) as practically as in practice. The new Virtual e-Learning System (Ve-LS) is experimental, allows automatic Information and Communications Technology (ICT) development, and offers an extraordinary SLE for increased global recognition. This paper focuses on IoT-Ve-LS, a tool for SLE. The IoT-Ve-LS domain has been fast-growing through the emerging technological trends of the IoT. The IoT-Ve-LS method used in the design and implementation allows flexible usage and integration of the online courses by SLE. The impacts of empirical E-learning evaluation on implementing IoT techniques in online tutoring have been analysed to find out its research hypothesis. Our IoT-sensor-based Reservoir Computing allows the classification of short-term learning language sentences relatively quickly, highlighting the minimal training time and optimized solution of real-time cases for controlling temporal and sequential signals at the cloud computing level.

;Effectiveness of Hybrid Learning as Technology Based Learning Model in the New Normal Era;Kusumajati, Dian Anggraini and Chairiyani, Rina Patriana and Kusumastuti, Fransiska Astri and Setianingsih, Niniek;;2023;ACM Digital Library;197–202;;Hybrid learning (HL) has become one of the learning models used when entering the new normal. Although various studies have measured HL, the effectiveness of HL model usage remains a concern for universities, especially Bina Nusantara University (BINUS) Jakarta. The main problem is that the use of hybrid learning conducted by BINUS is new. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of hybrid learning as technology-based learning by students in BINUS Jakarta. The population in this study was active students of BINUS Jakarta, totaling 127 students. The technique of collecting the sample was using random sampling. The statistical method uses Pearson correlation analysis and description. Based on the descriptive analysis the results found that hybrid learning was reflected in the role of technology (helps students in finding the information needed for learning by using gadgets and computers), campus commitment (providing internet facilities, Wi-Fi, computers, audio connectors, television, cameras, internet, and InFocus in each class), learning activities (presentations and discussions, independent assignments, group assignments in the form of projects (problem based), and final tests), and student readiness (previously using a blended learning process). There are 81.1% of students in BINUS Jakarta who feel that the hybrid learning system is effective in the learning process carried out during the Covid-19 condition, at the same time preparing for the new normal era. Hybrid learning, which is most effective for students in BINUS Jakarta, can be felt when there is the role of technology, campus commitment, learning activities, and students' readiness to participate in learning.;;10.1145/3584871.3584899;https://doi.org/10.1145/3584871.3584899;;;Technology-based, Student, New Normal, Hybrid Learning, Effectiveness, Covid-19;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

ASD is a lifelong disorder and characterized by difficulties in social communication skills and may exhibit a restricted or repetitive set of behaviors. The number of children with ASD is soaring worldwide. There are no platforms that facilitate remote and interactive learning for children with ASD. In this paper, we describe the process of ideation, and design of an interactive educational platform that utilizes the role of mixed-reality (real-time teaching and virtual teaching) to enable remote learning for children with ASD. This work is a product of our continuous collaboration with special education and assistive technology centers based in Qatar in which we have developed an augmented reality (AR) vocabulary learning application for children with ASD in English and Arabic. The application provides the learning of letters and words in an interactive environment. We plan to extend this app to a full-educational platform using mixed-reality. The ideation and design processes were conducted collaboratively with teachers and specialists. In this platform, the child will be learning in a real-time environment when a teacher, child, and parents are all online together at a given time; however, in the absence of a teacher, a robotic talkative avatar would support a child and its parents in a virtual environment. The teachers will also have the capability to communicate with the children and their parents through the platform.

;Teaching internet of things (IoT) literacy: a systems engineering approach;Silvis-Cividjian, Natalia;;2019;ACM Digital Library;50–61;;"The Internet of Things (IoT) invades our world with billions of smart, interconnected devices, all programmed to make our lives easier. For educators, teaching such a vast and dynamic field is both a necessity and a challenge. IoT-relevant topics such as programming, hardware, networking and artificial intelligence are already covered in core computing curricula. Does this mean that fresh graduates are well prepared to tackle complex IoT problems? Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The problem is that IoT devices are complex systems, where software, hardware, and humans interact with each other. From this interaction, unique behavior and hazardous situations can emerge that might easily stay undetected, unless systems are analyzed as a whole. This paper presents two differently flavored courses that teach IoT using a holistic, system-centric approach. The first is a broad introduction to Pervasive Computing, focused on the intelligence of ""Things"". The second is an advanced course that zooms on the process of testing a software-intensive system. The key characteristics of our approach are: (1) teaching only the bare essentials (topics needed for end-to-end engineering of a smart system), (2) a strong, hands-on project component, using microcontroller-based miniature systems, inspired by real-life, and (3) a rich partnership with industry and academic idea incubators. Positive student evaluations gathered during the last five years demonstrate that such an approach brings engagement, self-confidence and realism in IoT classrooms. We believe that this success can be replicated in other courses, by shifting the focus on different IoT-relevant aspects.";;10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2019.00014;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2019.00014;;;systems engineering, software testing, software engineering, safety-critical systems, robotic kits, pervasive computing, microcontrollers, insulin pump, embedded systems, computer science education, autonomous vehicles, academia-industry cooperation;IEEE Press;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Recently, software engineering researchers have started to explore virtual reality as a tool for programmers. However, few studies examine source code comprehension in VR. This paper explores the human experience of comprehending source code in VR and compares it to source code comprehension in a desktop environment. We conducted a study with 26 graduate student programmers. We measured actual productivity, perceived productivity and used the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) survey to measure various factors such as mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. We found that the programmers experienced more physical demand, effort, and overall task load when reading and comprehending code in VR. However, we did not observe any statistically significant differences in the programmers’ measured productivity or perceived productivity between VR and desktop comprehension.;;10.1007/s10664-022-10196-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-022-10196-5;;;Virtual reality, Human experience, Code comprehension;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1382-3256;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Evaluation of XR Applications: A Tertiary Review;Becker, Artur and Freitas, Carla M. Dal Sasso;ACM Comput. Surv.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;56;Extended reality (XR) applications—encompassing virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality—are finding their way into multiple domains. Each area has different motivations for employing and different criteria for evaluating XR. Multiple surveys describe XR and its evaluation in particular fields. However, these surveys do not always agree on the definition of XR. This lack of consensus makes it hard to compare and use learnings from XR research across areas. Through a tertiary systematic literature review, we analyzed 81 surveys from several fields to provide a comprehensive summary of the state of XR research regarding the evaluation of XR applications. We seek to understand (i) how is XR defined? (ii) why is XR employed? (iii) how is XR evaluated?

;Assessing a Multidisciplinary Group of Undergraduate Students Applying the Challenge Based Learning Methodology to Learn Mobile Development;da Costa, Andrew Diniz and Coelho, Hendi Lemos and Venieris, Ricardo Almeida and de Lucena, Carlos Jos\'{e} Pereira and Carvalho, Gustavo Robichez and Pereira, Marcelo Fernandes;;2020;ACM Digital Library;700–709;;Assessment is an important part of the learning experience, because it helps to clarify what students regard as important, how they spend their time and how they come to see themselves as learners. Besides, assessing students using new learning methodologies, which avoid the idea of teachers as the center of knowledge and students as secondary actors, allow us to understand their advantages and disadvantages. Challenge Based Learning (CBL) is one of these proposals, created with the essential principles of which skills are expected to the 21st century. This paper presents an experience applying an assessment approach during one year to a multidisciplinary group of students, who learned how to develop mobile applications using CBL and came from different universities and courses. The main focus is to allow those students to learn to self-assess them, understand their learning progress on ten technical topics, and share learned lessons from that experience.;;10.1145/3422392.3422484;https://doi.org/10.1145/3422392.3422484;;;self-assessment, multidisciplinary groups, mobile development, Challenge Based Learning;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Human Joint Localization Method for Virtual Reality Based on Multi-device Data Fusion;Chang, Zihan and Di, Xiaofei and Che, Xiaoping and Liu, Haiming and Su, Jingxi and Qu, Chenxin;;2024;ACM Digital Library;323–335;;Virtual reality (VR) utilizes computer vision, artificial intelligence and other techniques to enable interaction between users and virtual environments. In order to solve the problems of human joint localization based on single device, multi-device data fusion technology has been adopted. In this paper, a multi-device data fusion method is proposed based on HTC Vive and Kinect. Firstly, two devices are utilized to separately capture motion data of human joints and the two sets of data are aligned temporally and unified in coordinates. Then the weights are respectively assigned to the two sets of data based on the different location of the human body. Next, particle filtering is adopted to combine the two sets of data. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network model is deployed, where the bone length loss is incorporated into the loss function to further improve the localization accuracy. Experiment results show that the localization accuracy of the proposed multi-device data fusion-based localization method outperforms that of the single device method.;;10.1007/978-3-031-50075-6_25;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-50075-6_25;;;Virtual reality, Data fusion, Human joint localization, Kinect, HTC Vive;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Potential Attempt to Treat Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Children with Engineering Education Games;Tan, Zhiya and Liu, Zhen and Gong, Shiqi;;2023;ACM Digital Library;166–184;;Over the past two decades, interventions for children and adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have greatly increased, especially gamification interventions, which have become a focus of research. However, gamified intervention therapy is still in the research and development stage, and few ADHD treatment games have been widely promoted. In the context of new engineering education development, games have been shown to have educational potential, primarily to increase learner engagement and motivation. Although ADHD treatment games and engineering education (EE) games are two different research hotspots, they may have the same characteristics to prove that engineering education games can be directly used in intervention therapy for ADHD children. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to explore the correlation between treatment games and engineering education games for ADHD children and to explore the potential of EE games as a direct intervention for children with ADHD. This paper utilizes the bibliometric research method that draws upon the Web of Science database as a source of literature, to perform a keyword co-occurrence analysis using VOSviewer visualization software, determines important research structures, and themes, and qualitatively reviews the literature to reveal deeper insights. Subsequently, this paper employs augmented reality (AR) EE Game for experiments, and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the potential of EE Game as a gamification intervention for ADHD children.;;10.1007/978-3-031-35708-4_13;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-35708-4_13;;;VOSviewer, Electroencephalography (EEG), Augmented Reality (AR), Gamified, Engineering Education, Gamification Intervention, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD);Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Leap Motion Controller Enabled Simulations of Personal Computer Assembly Programs;Tayag, Marlon and Ronie, Bituin and Marvin, Reyes;;2021;ACM Digital Library;17–21;;The merging of both physical and virtual worlds into one seamless reality is an idea that has been tackled by many disciplines such as computer science, psychology, sociology and even literary genres like science fiction. One such amalgamation is Mixed Reality, which allows for physical and digital objects to co-exist and interact in real time, and it has been used in different areas such as entertainment to military training. This research explores the possibilities for creating collaborative mixed reality in an educational context. In this paper, we developed two (2) simulated realities. The one uses Conventional Screen typically found or see in games and where there are perspective cameras which is First Person Perspective and Third Person Perspective. While the other one is inside Mixed Reality paradigm, where reality and virtual objects co-exist, and used the Leap Motion Controller to support mid-air gestures (controls). We performed comparison between the two simulations and also measure Mixed Reality application. Also, we present how mixed reality applications can be used as an alternative method in exhibiting topics.;;10.1145/3451471.3451474;https://doi.org/10.1145/3451471.3451474;;;MR (Mixed Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality), Leap Motion, Gyroscope, Dual Reality, AR (Augmented Reality);Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A Study of User Privacy in Android Mobile AR Apps;Yang, Xiaoyi and Zhang, Xueling;;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;With the development of augmented reality (AR) technology, the use of mobile AR applications (MAR apps) is rising rapidly in various aspects of people’s everyday lives, such as games, shopping, and education. When compared to traditional apps, AR apps typically need access to the smartphone’s camera all the time and collect and analyze significantly more data, such as sensor data, geolocation, and biometric information. Due to the sensitivity and volume of data collected by MAR apps, new privacy concerns are raised. In this paper, we describe a preliminary empirical study of Android MAR apps in terms of the sensitive data collected by MAR apps, whether the collected data is well protected, and whether the data practice is publicly available so that users can learn about the data safety and make informed decisions when deciding which apps to install. In this study, we analyzed 390 real-world MAR apps and reported the dangerous permissions they requested, the data leaks detected in them, and the availability of their data safety.;;10.1145/3551349.3560512;https://doi.org/10.1145/3551349.3560512;;;user privacy, privacy leak, mobile application, data safety;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A Mixed Reality Approach for Innovative Pair Programming Education with a Conversational AI Virtual Avatar;Manfredi, Gilda and Erra, Ugo and Gilio, Gabriele;;2023;ACM Digital Library;450–454;;Pair Programming (PP) is an Agile software development methodology that involves two developers working together on a single computer. However, the physical presence of two developers has become a challenge in recent years due to the pandemic, necessitating remote collaboration methods such as Distributed Pair Programming (DPP). DPP has been found to have similar benefits to in-person PP, but the issue of team compatibility remains unresolved. These are more evident in the educational field of Agile methodologies. To address these challenges, we developed a novel approach by creating a Mixed Reality (MR) application that enables users to learn PP with the assistance of a conversational intelligent virtual avatar. The application uses the HoloLens MR device and a Conversational Agent (CA) extension integrated into Visual Studio Code to provide suggestions for improving the code written by the user. The virtual avatar animates these suggestions, making it appear to speak and interact with the user in real time. This system aims to overcome the limitations of common DPP methods, allowing a single developer to learn and apply the PP methodology even when a human partner is unavailable.;;10.1145/3593434.3593952;https://doi.org/10.1145/3593434.3593952;;;pair programming, extended reality, conversational agents, artificial intelligence;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Comparison Between the Methods of Adjustment and Constant Stimuli for the Estimation of Redirection Detection Thresholds;Chen, Weiya and Ladev\`{e}ze, Nicolas and Hu, Wei and Ou, Shiqi and Bourdot, Patrick;;2019;ACM Digital Library;226–245;;Redirection Detection Thresholds (RDTs) are defined to represent the limits of undetectable gains and serve as important input parameters for redirected walking algorithms. However, it is not trivial to get a user’s RDT estimation in a few trials with existing methods such as the commonly used Method of Constant Stimuli (MCS). In aim to achieve efficient RDT estimation, we chose a classic psychophysical method - the Method of Adjustment (MoA), and compared it against MCS with a series of within-subject experiments respectively on translation, rotation and curvature gains. The results show that MoA gets overall similar RDT estimations with MCS over the same population, except for some systematic differences on translation and rotation gains. Moreover, MoA (with 20 trials) saves about 33% experiment time when compared against MCS, and has the potential to save more as the results of MoA remain relatively stable when the number of trials decreases. Further studies are needed to compare MoA with adaptive methods and to discover the potential relationship between RDTs and perception traits at individual level.;;10.1007/978-3-030-31908-3_14;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31908-3_14;;;Method of adjustment, Detection threshold, Redirected walking, Navigation;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Can Cross-Reality Help Nonspeaking Autistic People Transition to AR Typing?;Alabood, Lorans and Dow, Travis and Kaufman, Kate M. and Jaswal, Vikram K. and Krishnamurthy, Diwakar;;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;"About 30% of autistic people are nonspeakers; they cannot use speech to communicate effectively. Pointing to letters on a letterboard held by a Communication and Regulation Partner (CRP) is one alternative method of expressive communication that some members of this population use. In the training of this method, a CRP delivers engaging and customized lessons. Additionally, the CRP provides regulatory, sensory, and attentional support and also works to strengthen the subject’s pointing skills. The goal of this training is to equip individuals with the required skills to be able to type independently. Recent studies have proposed using AR to provide opportunities for nonspeakers to practice the motor skills involved in typing. To use such systems, however, there needs to be a transition phase where a CRP teaches their subject how to interact with a virtual letterboard. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using cross-reality, in which a CRP and nonspeaker can interact with the same virtual objects simultaneously, as a possible means of fostering this transition. We report a study involving 5 nonspeaking autistic subjects with diverse motor skills interacting using a virtual HoloLens 2 letterboard system we developed called HoloBoard. All subjects succeeded in pointing to letters correctly or spelling on the virtual board. We report process and design recommendations based on feedback obtained from subjects and their CRPs.";;10.1145/3544549.3585859;https://doi.org/10.1145/3544549.3585859;;;cross-reality, augmented reality, assistive technology, Nonspeaking autistic people;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A longitudinal study of popular ad libraries in the Google Play Store;Ahasanuzzaman, Md and Hassan, Safwat and Bezemer, Cor-Paul and Hassan, Ahmed E.;Empirical Softw. Engg.;2020;ACM Digital Library;824–858;25;"In-app advertisements have become an integral part of the revenue model of mobile apps. To gain ad revenue, app developers integrate ad libraries into their apps. Such libraries are integrated to serve advertisements (ads) to users; developers then gain revenue based on the displayed ads and the users’ interactions with such ads. As a result, ad libraries have become an essential part of the mobile app ecosystem. However, little is known about how such ad libraries have evolved over time. In this paper, we study the evolution of the 8 most popular ad libraries (e.g., Google AdMob and Facebook Audience Network) over a period of 33 months (from April 2016 until December 2018). In particular, we look at their evolution in terms of size, the main drivers for releasing a new version, and their architecture. To identify popular ad libraries, we collect 35,462 updates of 1,840 top free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store. Then, we identify 63 ad libraries that are integrated into the studied popular apps. We observe that an ad library represents 10% of the binary size of mobile apps, and that the proportion of the ad library size compared to the app size has grown by 10% over our study period. By taking a closer look at the 8 most popular ad libraries, we find that ad libraries are continuously evolving with a median release interval of 34 days. In addition, we observe that some libraries have grown exponentially in size (e.g, Facebook Audience Network), while other libraries have attempted to reduce their size as they evolved. The libraries that reduced their size have done so through: (1) creating a lighter version of the ad library, (2) removing parts of the ad library, and (3) redesigning their architecture into a more modular one. To identify the main drivers for releasing a new version, we manually analyze the release notes of the eight studied ad libraries. We observe that fixing issues that are related to displaying video ads is the main driver for releasing new versions. We also observe that ad library developers are constantly updating their libraries to support a wider range of Android platforms (i.e., to ensure that more devices can use the libraries without errors). Finally, we derive a reference architecture from the studied eight ad libraries, and we study how these libraries deviated from this architecture in the study period. Our study is important for ad library developers as it provides the first in-depth look into how the important mobile app market segment of ad libraries has evolved. Our findings and the reference architecture are valuable for ad library developers who wish to learn about how other developers built and evolved their successful ad libraries. For example, our reference architecture provides a new ad library developer with a foundation for understanding the interactions between the most important components of an ad library.";;10.1007/s10664-019-09766-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-019-09766-x;;;Software engineering, Longitudinal study, Google Play store, Ad library, Android mobile apps;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1382-3256;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

At present, there are some problems in the construction of digital museum in China, such as backward concept, low overall level, lack of funds and talents. Digital museum is a museum that uses digital and network technology to present the functions of physical museum on the network in a digital way. It includes three parts: the on-site digital display system of the museum exhibition hall, the museum business management system based on network digital technology and the network platform display system. This paper designs and implements a new intelligent digital museum system based on the hybrid reality technology. Compared with the existing digital museum navigation mode, the system gets rid of the tedious way of navigation, provides tourists with more diverse and realistic cultural relics information, and makes the human–computer interaction more humanized. The museum construction in the future will continue to be digital, networked and intelligent, which provides a good practice platform and a broad development world for the improvement and application of new technologies. Besides, the software-driven data collection and analysis models are combined for the systematic performance improvement of the model.

;Evaluating and redefining smartphone permissions with contextualized justifications for mobile augmented reality apps;Harborth, David and Frik, Alisa;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;;Augmented reality (AR), and specifically mobile augmented reality (MAR) gained much public attention after the success of Pok\'{e}mon Go in 2016, and since then has found application in online games, social media, entertainment, real estate, interior design, and other services. MAR apps are highly dependent on real time context-specific information provided by the different sensors and data processing capabilities of smartphones (e.g., LiDAR, gyroscope or object recognition). This dependency raises crucial privacy issues for end users. We evaluate whether the existing access permission systems, initially developed for non-AR apps, as well as proposed new permissions, relevant for MAR apps, provide sufficient and clear information to the users. We address this research goal in two online survey-based experiments with a total of 581 participants. Based on our results, we argue that it is necessary to increase transparency about MAR apps' data practices by requesting users' permissions to access certain novel and privacy invasive resources and functionalities commonly used in MAR apps, such as speech and face recognition. We also find that adding justifications, contextualized to the data collection practices of the app, improves transparency and can mitigate privacy concerns, at least in the context of data utilized to the users' benefit. Better understanding of the app's practices and lower concerns, in turn, increase the intentions to grant permissions. We provide recommendations for better transparency in MAR apps.;;;;;;;USENIX Association;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Rendering multi-party mobile augmented reality from edge;Zhang, Lei and Sun, Andy and Shea, Ryan and Liu, Jiangchuan and Zhang, Miao;;2019;ACM Digital Library;67–72;;Mobile augmented reality (MAR) augments a real-world environment (probably surrounding or close to the mobile user) by computer-generated perceptual information. Utilizing the emerging edge computing paradigm in MAR systems can reduce the power consumption and computation load for the mobile devices and improve responsiveness of the MAR service. Different from existing studies that mainly explored how to better enable the MAR services utilizing edge computing resources, our focus is to optimize the video generation stage of the edge-based MAR services-efficiently using the available edge computing resources to render and encode the augmented reality as video streams to the mobile clients. Specifically, for multi-party AR applications, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of two encoding schemes, namely colocated encoding and spilt encoding, and examine the trade-off between performance and scalability when the rendering and encoding tasks are colocated or split. Towards optimally placing AR video rendering and encoding in the edge, we formulate and solve the rendering and encoding task assignment problem for multi-party edge-based MAR services to maximize the QoS for the users and the edge computing efficiency. The proposed task assignment scheme is proved to be superior through extensive trace-driven simulations and experiments on our prototype system.;;10.1145/3304112.3325612;https://doi.org/10.1145/3304112.3325612;;;mobile, edge computing, augmented reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Enhancing subject matter assessments utilizing augmented reality and serious game techniques;Holtkamp, Brian and Alshair, Mohammed and Biediger, Daniel and Wilson, Michael and Yun, Chang and Kim, Kyungki;;2019;ACM Digital Library;;;In this paper, we utilize the Microsoft HoloLens, a wearable augmented-reality (AR) device, to investigate how well an AR-based assessment tool measures a student's comprehension of, skill in, and aptitude for a given subject matter. We added assessment capabilities to a serious game prototype built in collaboration with Construction Management faculty for their Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety course. In an effort to verify if these assessment elements are effective, we hosted a trial with sixteen university students who were enrolled in the OSHA safety course.The trial consisted of a traditional pen-and-paper exam and an AR-based assessment. The AR-based assessment required the students to identify unsafe situations of virtually simulated workers, construction equipment, and/or vehicles in an AR diorama of an active construction site. We selected OSHA topics from eight categories ranging from proper ladder usage on the work site to workers wearing the correct protective equipment for where they are and what they're doing.We find that 1.) students who performed well on a paper-based assessment also performed well within the AR-based assessment tool, 2.) students and faculty considered the AR trial more comprehensive and representative of knowledge, and 3.) user feedback reinforced the visual and interactive benefits of the AR over the paper-based exam. This trial shows promising results to adapt serious games and AR assessments into Computer Science and interdisciplinary subject matters that rely on visualization and spatial understanding.;;10.1145/3337722.3337743;https://doi.org/10.1145/3337722.3337743;;;serious games, education, augmented reality, assessment;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Impacts of augmented reality on foreign language teaching: a case study of Persian language;Mozaffari, Sonia and Hamidi, Hamid Reza;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2022;ACM Digital Library;4735–4748;82;"The use of information technology in the field of foreign language teaching as an auxiliary tool is very important. In a foreign language classroom, place is just an abstract concept; where the language is separated from the community, culture and places in which it is used. Augmented reality is a technology in which virtual components are simultaneously combined with the real environment. Our aim in this study is to investigate the effects of location-based augmented reality in teaching Persian as a foreign language. In this study, after consulting with professors in the field of Persian language teaching and reviewing similar researches, we came to the conclusion that nothing has been done to teach Persian language using augmented reality. Therefore, a Persian game based on augmented reality was designed and implemented and then evaluated. For evaluation, two methods have been used; the user and the heuristic evaluation. Experts in the field of Persian language teaching, human-computer interaction and a number of language learners participated in the evaluation. Their feedback shows that the use of augmented reality increases satisfaction, enthusiasm and interaction with the environment and people, and also makes the process of learning and memorizing concepts more efficient.";;10.1007/s11042-022-13370-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13370-5;;;Persian, Foreign Language, Language Teaching, Augmented reality;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Some non-agile developers integrate certain agile and design thinking practices in their development. Among these practices include identifying personas, creating empathy and journey maps and writing user stories. This research adopts the Design Science Research Methodology, focusing on integrating agile and design thinking practices in generating quality user stories in the design of augmented reality (AR) applications. An integrated development process is modelled and applied in an example application, an AR application for student welfare services events. The study goes through the process of eliciting user requirements by identifying user personas, creating empathy maps and customer journeys and writing user stories as part of the discovery stage of the AR application development. The user stories are evaluated by fifteen agile practitioners based on fourteen criteria adapted from Quality User Story Framework.

;"AR Patterns: Event-Driven Design Patterns in&nbsp;Creating Augmented Reality Experiences";Ackermann, Philipp;;2023;ACM Digital Library;93–114;;Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) enable superimposing digital content onto the real world. These technologies have now matured to a point where low-code/no-code editors for AR development have emerged. However, existing collections of design principles for AR often fall short, either being too generic or overly focused on low-level details. This makes it challenging to identify the essential patterns necessary for creating captivating AR experiences. This paper addresses this issue by introducing high-level AR design patterns encompassing fundamental concepts for crafting immersive AR experiences. Event-Condition-Action rules are leveraged as a generic abstraction from the reactive behavior of AR software systems to establish a unified framework. AR-specific behavioral patterns and augmentation patterns are presented in detail. Additionally, a uniform pattern diagram schema is proposed that ensures consistent presentation and technology-agnostic documentation of AR design patterns, facilitating their effective use in design and creation of AR applications.;;10.1007/978-3-031-48495-7_6;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-48495-7_6;;;AR Pattern Diagram, Active Rules, Scene Understanding, Reactive AR, Design Patterns, Augmented Reality;Springer-Verlag;;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This study reports findings from a systematic mapping review, based on a total of forty-five (n = 45) articles published in international peer-reviewed journals from 2010 to 2020, after evaluating the use of AR applications that support Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects’ learning in HE settings. This review’s results highlighted the lack of research across the STEM spectrum, especially in the Technology and Mathematics subfields, as well as the scarcity of location-based and markerless AR applications. Furthermore, three augmentation techniques, suitable for STEM learning, were identified and analysed: augmentation of laboratory specialised equipment, physical objects and course handbooks or sheets. The main contribution of this article is a taxonomy of instructional models and the discussion of applied instructional strategies and techniques in STEM fields focused on HE settings. In addition, we provide visualisations of the present state of the area, which aim at encouraging and scaffolding educators’ efforts based on specific classification criteria to develop AR experiences and conduct further research to enhance STEM learning.;;10.1007/s10639-021-10682-1;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10682-1;;;Systematic mapping, STEM, Instructional design, Higher education, Augmented reality;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1360-2357;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Acceptance of dance training system based on augmented reality and technology acceptance model (TAM);Iqbal, Javid and Sidhu, Manjit Singh;Virtual Real.;2022;ACM Digital Library;33–54;26;The advancement in Computer Vision (CV) has evolved drastically from image processing to object recognition, tracking video, restoration of images, three-dimensional (3D) pose recognition, and emotion analysis. These advancements have eventually led to the birth of Augmented Reality (AR) technology, which means embedding virtual objects into the real-world environment. The primary focus of this research was to solve the long-term learning retention and poor learning efficiency for mastering a dance skill through the AR technology based on constructivism learning theory, Dreyfus model and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The problem analysis carried out in this research had major research findings, in which the retention and learning efficiency of a dance training system were predominantly determined through the type of learning theory adopted, learning environment, training tools, skill acquisition technology and type of AR technique. Therefore, the influential factors for the user acceptance of AR-based dance training system (ARDTS) were based on quantitative analysis. These influential factors were determined to address the problem of knowledge gap on acceptance of AR-based systems for dance education through self-learning. The evaluation and testing were conducted to validate the developed and implemented ARDTS system. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the evaluation model and quantitative analysis was done with a research instrument that encompassed external and internal variables. TAM consisted of 37 items, in which six factors were used to assess the new developed ARDTS by the authors and its acceptability among 86 subjects. The current study had investigated the potential use of AR-based dance training system to promote a particular dance skill among a sample population with various backgrounds and interests. The obtained results support a general acceptance towards ARDTS among the users who are interested in exploring the cutting-edge technology of AR for gaining expertise in a dance skill.;;10.1007/s10055-021-00529-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-021-00529-y;;;Interactive system, Augmented reality, Dance learning, User acceptance, Kinect V2;Springer-Verlag;1359-4338;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A review on the attention mechanism of deep learning;Zhaoyang Niu and Guoqiang Zhong and Hui Yu;Neurocomputing;2021;Science@Direct;48-62;452;Attention has arguably become one of the most important concepts in the deep learning field. It is inspired by the biological systems of humans that tend to focus on the distinctive parts when processing large amounts of information. With the development of deep neural networks, attention mechanism has been widely used in diverse application domains. This paper aims to give an overview of the state-of-the-art attention models proposed in recent years. Toward a better general understanding of attention mechanisms, we define a unified model that is suitable for most attention structures. Each step of the attention mechanism implemented in the model is described in detail. Furthermore, we classify existing attention models according to four criteria: the softness of attention, forms of input feature, input representation, and output representation. Besides, we summarize network architectures used in conjunction with the attention mechanism and describe some typical applications of attention mechanism. Finally, we discuss the interpretability that attention brings to deep learning and present its potential future trends.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.03.091;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092523122100477X;;;Attention mechanism, Deep learning, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Encoder-decoder, Unified attention model, Computer vision applications, Natural language processing applications;;0925-2312;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Software engineering is becoming more and more distributed. Developers and other stakeholders are often located in different locations, departments, and countries and operating within different time zones. Most online software design and modeling tools are not adequate for distributed collaboration since they do not support awareness and lack features for effective communication.
Objective:
The aim of our research is to support distributed software design activities in Virtual Reality (VR).
Method:
Using design science research methodology, we design and evaluate a tool for collaborative design in VR. We evaluate the collaboration efficiency and recall of design information when using the VR software design environment compared to a non-VR software design environment. Moreover, we collect the perceptions and preferences of users to explore the opportunities and challenges that were incurred by using the VR software design environment.
Results:
We find that there is no significant difference in the efficiency and recall of design information when using the VR compared to the non-VR environment. Furthermore, we find that developers are more satisfied with collaboration in VR.
Conclusion:
The results of our research and similar studies show that working in VR is not yet faster or more efficient than working on standard desktops.

;A holistic approach for cross-platform software development;J.Z. Blanco and D. Lucrédio;Journal of Systems and Software;2021;Science@Direct;110985;179;Cross-platform development solutions can help to make software available on different devices and platforms. But these are normally restricted to preconfigured platforms and consider that each individual solution is equal or similar to each other. As a result, developers have to resort to native development and build individual solutions, one for each device/platform, that cooperate to deliver the desired global functionality. This article presents an approach that takes advantage of existing solutions and have support for extending and including new platforms, and distributing functionality across devices. The approach is based on a general-purpose language that raises the abstraction level in order to keep the software free from platform details. Automatic transformations produce executable code that can be properly divided and deployed separately into different platforms. The proposed approach was evaluated in four ways. In the first evaluation, an existing cross-platform system was recreated using the approach. The second and third evaluations was conducted with expert and novice developers, who tested the approach in practice. The fourth evaluation introduced support for cross-platform testing. Results have brought evidence supporting the following main contributions: use of a single environment, the ability to reuse similar concepts between platforms and the potential to reduce costs.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.110985;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221000820;;;Cross-platform development, General-purpose language, Model-driven development, User studies;;0164-1212;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45359;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The main goal is the creation of a technological infrastructure for the permanent enhancement of cultural resources. Hence, ArkaeVision represents a user-centric integrated system able to offer different modalities of exploitation of Cultural Heritage assets, including virtual representations of monuments, works of art and objects, as well as the stories associated to them. ArkaeVision therefore introduces a new communication paradigm, made of game-alike exploration of a 3D environment, virtually reconstructed, with elements of digital fiction and an engaging stortytelling, applied to two case studies: the exploration of the Hera II Temple of Paestum with Virtual Reality (VR) technology, and the exploration of the slab of the Swimmer Tomb with Augmented Reality (AR). The emotional component is fundamental in ArkaeVision, because it generates the motivation and leads people to use immersive viewers, as the HTC Vive, which allow the learning process to be activated more quickly, as many cognitivists and psychologists reported in the latest researches. Also the involvement of users through gamification is well expressed in ArkaeVision. This model of action (and interaction) designed for the public allows to emphasize the role of users through a system that is “guided” by their choices and times, in order to increase users’ engagement within the virtual exploration, and favour the content understanding by direct experience. Evaluations conducted on a preliminary prototype suggested that the communicative approach is very promising for education and engagement into cultural heritage experiences.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.daach.2019.e00124;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054819300232;;;Virtual reality, Augmented reality, Gamification, Digital storytelling, User experience design;;2212-0548;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Implementing Virtuality in Production - a Design Science Approach;Manuel Brunner and Herbert Jodlbauer and Nadine Bachmann and Shailesh Tripathi;Procedia Computer Science;2023;Science@Direct;988-997;217;The trend toward smart production is omnipresent in research over recent years and there are different approaches how to making a production smart. One of these approaches is to enrich reality with virtual aspects. Alongside the efforts to make production smarter by implementing augmented and virtual reality devices arise the challenges like motion sickness, usability, the weight of devices, or simply the complexity of the implementation process. A forced implementation of smart applications could lead to the frustration of the applicants and ruin the fruitful ground for improvement. The right position for the implementation of virtuality measures as well as the right dose of implementation is essential for success. This paper aims to connect an existing comprehensive approach with the implementation process of virtuality in production and show that such a scientific-based approach supports such a task. Design science research offers an existing, well-elaborated framework for complex tasks and bears the potential to support a virtuality implementation process. This led to the research question: Does design science as an existing research framework support the virtuality implementation process in production? Design science defines the environment of application as characterized by people (in different roles and capabilities) an organization (with different processes and structures) and technologies (like infrastructure and communication). This environment could be seen as the production environment. Further, we do have a broad knowledge base due to the profound work of the academic community in the field of augmented and virtual reality and a huge methodological toolbox. The existing environment and knowledge base are the basements to create an artifact, evaluate, and reshaping it. With this paper, we suggest a design science research-based procedure to support the implementation of virtuality in production. Design science research comes out from information science and is more and more applied in other research fields. As a result of our work, we saw that following a structured approach like the design science approach has the potential to support companies to successfully implement virtuality measures in production.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.297;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050922023754;;;Virtuality, Implementation, Support, Production, Design Science;;1877-0509;;4th International Conference on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Interact.;2022;ACM Digital Library;;6;Augmented reality changes the way we perceive reality and how we interact with computers. However, we argue that to create augmented reality solutions, we need to rethink the way we develop software. In this paper, we review the state of the art in software engineering for augmented reality applications, derive open questions, and define a research agenda. For this purpose, we consider different engineering phases and evaluate conventional techniques regarding their applicability for AR development. In requirements engineering, we found the integration of AR experts and the associated collaboration between actors to be of key aspect in the development process. Additionally, requirements about the physical world must be considered, which in turn has a huge impact on UI design. The relevance of the physical environment is not yet sufficiently addressed in applicable techniques, which also applies to current implementation frameworks and tools, complicating the AR development process. When evaluating AR software iterations, we found interaction testing and test automation to have great potential, although they have not yet been sufficiently researched. Our paper contributes to AR research by revealing current core challenges within the AR development process and formulating explicit research questions that should be considered by future research.;;10.1145/3532205;https://doi.org/10.1145/3532205;;;tools, software engineering, methods, frameworks, augmented reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Processos da Engenharia de Software pra desenvolvimento da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Towards requirements engineering with immersive augmented reality;Patkar, Nitish and Merino, Leonel and Nierstrasz, Oscar;;2020;ACM Digital Library;55–60;;Often, requirements engineering (RE) activities demand project stakeholders to communicate and collaborate with each other towards building a common software product vision. We conjecture that augmented reality (AR) can be a good fit to support such communication and collaboration. In this vision paper, we report on state-of-the-art research at the intersection of AR and RE. We found that requirements elicitation and analysis have been supported by the ability of AR to provision on-the-fly information such as augmented prototypes. We discuss and map the existing challenges in RE to the aspects of AR that can boost the productivity and user experience of existing RE techniques. Finally, we elaborate on various envisioned usage scenarios in which we highlight concrete benefits and challenges of adopting immersive AR to assist project stakeholders in RE activities.;;10.1145/3397537.3398472;https://doi.org/10.1145/3397537.3398472;;;Requirements Engineering, RE, Immersive Augmented Reality, IAR for RE, IAR, Augmented Reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45442;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;The Role of Edge Offload for Hardware-Accelerated Mobile Devices;Satyanarayanan, Mahadev and Beckmann, Nathan and Lewis, Grace A. and Lucia, Brandon;;2021;ACM Digital Library;22–29;;This position paper examines a spectrum of approaches to overcoming the limited computing power of mobile devices caused by their need to be small, lightweight and energy efficient. At one extreme is offloading of compute-intensive operations to a cloudlet nearby. At the other extreme is the use of fixed-function hardware accelerators on mobile devices. Between these endpoints lie various configurations of programmable hardware accelerators. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches and conclude that they are, in fact, complementary. Based on this insight, we advocate a software-hardware co-evolution path that combines their strengths.;;10.1145/3446382.3448360;https://doi.org/10.1145/3446382.3448360;;;5G, ASIC, GPU, TCB, cyber foraging, devops, disconnected operation, edge computing, latency, mobile computing, offloading, stealth;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;The effect of reducing distraction on the flow-performance link in virtual experiential learning environment;Bian, Yulong and Zhou, Chao and Liu, Juan and Geng, Wenxiu and Shi, Ying;Virtual Real.;2022;ACM Digital Library;1277–1290;26;In virtual experiential learning environment (VELE), distraction can reduce learners’ flow experience, learning performance, and the link between them, which are important aspects for high-quality learning. Based on the weak association model (WAM), we proposed two potential guidelines to deal with distraction and then improve these aspects. Guideline1 is directly decreasing the amount of attractive but task-irrelevant distractors in VELE. Guideline2 is enhancing the congruence between distractors and primary task by guiding attention from task-irrelevant distractors to task-relevant elements. To explore the effect of the guidelines, this paper develops a prototype VR experiential learning system, based on which two experiments were performed. Experiment 1 and experiment 2, respectively, conducted a comparative experiment to test the effect of guideline 1 and guideline 2 on flow, performance, and flow-performance link. Results show that both guidelines helped enhance the learning performance without any damage on flow experience and alleviated the weak flow-performance link. The two guidelines provide easy ways to guide task-relevant attention to optimize VELE.;;10.1007/s10055-021-00621-3;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-021-00621-3;;;Virtual reality, Experiential learning, Flow-performance link, Distraction, Guideline;Springer-Verlag;1359-4338;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;The Role of Technology to Teaching and Learning Sign Languages: A Systematic Mapping;Falvo, Venilton and Scatalon, Lilian Passos and Francine Barbosa, Ellen;;2020;ACM Digital Library;1–9;;"Context: The teaching and learning process has become essential for the evolution of the society as a whole. However, there are still major challenges for achieving the global goals of education, especially if we consider the portion of the population with some type of physical disability. In this context, according to World Federation of the Deaf (WFD), deaf children face many difficulties in education due to inappropriate learning environments. Also, this problem is compounded by the lack of consistency worldwide in the provision of sign language interpreting and translation. Motivation: However, the advent of technology is having a significant impact on the way that sign language interpreters and translators work. In this sense, the union between Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and modern pedagogical practices can be the genesis for the creation of a global learning environment based on sign languages. Objective: In this scenario, this work aims to: (i) obtain an overview of the areas of Software Engineering and their technological solutions in the fields of teaching and learning sign languages; (ii) identify the main educational topics; and (iii) the most investigated sign languages. Method: Therefore, we conduct a Systematic Mapping (SM) with a focus on technologies applied in the teaching and learning of sign languages. Results: We selected 139 primary studies, using a search approach that includes both manual and automated searches, in addition to providing quality criteria for evaluating results. Thereby, we obtained pertinent information about the implemented solutions, in addition to the educational topics and sign languages covered. Conclusions: We conclude that technologies have already contributed to the teaching and learning of sign languages. In this context, different approaches were found, from solutions on traditional platforms (Web, Mobile and Desktop) to the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in smart glasses. However, no solution aims to enable communication between different sign languages, which shows a limitation that can motivate even more innovative research.";;10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274169;https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274169;;;;IEEE Press;;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;PredART: Towards Automatic Oracle Prediction of Object Placements in Augmented Reality Testing;Rafi, Tahmid and Zhang, Xueling and Wang, Xiaoyin;;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;While the emerging Augmented Reality (AR) technique allows a lot of new application opportunities, from education and communication to gaming, current augmented apps often have complaints about their usability and/or user experience due to placement errors of virtual objects. Therefore, identifying noticeable placement errors is an important goal in the testing of AR apps. However, placement errors can only be perceived by human beings and may need to be confirmed by multiple users, making automatic testing very challenging. In this paper, we propose PredART, a novel approach to predict human ratings of virtual object placements that can be used as test oracles in automated AR testing. PredART is based on automatic screenshot sampling, crowd sourcing, and a hybrid neural network for image regression. The evaluation on a test set of 480 screenshots shows that our approach can achieve an accuracy of 85.0% and a mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error of 0.047, 0.008, and 0.091, respectively.;;10.1145/3551349.3561160;https://doi.org/10.1145/3551349.3561160;;;Virtual Objects, Placement Error, Augmented Reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Higher education institutions, however, are struggling to keep abreast of its development and to train specialists quickly, providing few courses which sufficiently align with the needs of industry. In addition to this, the field is developing so rapidly that existing courses struggle to keep pace. They also often focus too narrowly on specifics to allow for the building of the formative foundations of AR education. This paper aims to address this need by proposing a blueprint curriculum in Computer Science Education for teaching AR in universities at two levels, foundations and advanced. To begin, we survey the state of the art, identifying common needs and problems in existing courses which focus on AR. We then detail a skills framework comprised of 12 groups of skills suitable to meet industry needs, and built upon it two model lesson plans for a foundation and an advanced course. We conclude with a discussion of assessment techniques and curricular design options of embedding such coursework into existing academic programs and a forecast of the future of this academic field.;;10.1145/3437800.3439205;https://doi.org/10.1145/3437800.3439205;;;software engineering, curriculum, augmented reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Chapter 12 - Big Data, data streaming, and the mobile cloud;Dan C. Marinescu;;2023;Science@Direct;453-500;;This chapter covers three of the most exciting and demanding classes of cloud applications: Big Data, data streaming, and mobile cloud computing. Big Data and data-streaming applications require low-latency, scalability, versatility, and a high degree of fault tolerance. Achieving these qualities at scale is extremely challenging. The defining attributes of Big Data are analyzed in Section 12.1. The next sections discuss how Big Data is stored and processed. High-capacity datastores and databases are necessary to store the very large volumes of data. Scaling data warehouses and databases poses its own challenges. The Mesa datastore and Spanner and F1 databases developed at Google are discussed in Section 12.2, while another class of Big Data applications, combining mathematical modeling with simulation and measurements, and the dynamic, data-driven applications (DDAS), are discussed in Section 12.3. Clouds host several classes of data-streaming applications, ranging from content-delivery data streaming to applications consuming a continuous stream of events. Such applications are discussed in Sections 12.4, 12.5, and 12.6. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearable devices, are ubiquitous and indispensable for living in a modern society. Mobile devices are in a symbiotic relationship with computer clouds, and their users benefit from the democratization of data processing. The user of a mobile device has access to the vast amounts of computing cycles and storage available on computer clouds. Mobile cloud computing enables the execution of mobile applications on mobile devices and on computer clouds. Mobile devices act as producers and consumers of the data stored on clouds and shared with others. Section 12.7 is an introduction to mobile computing and its applications, while Section 12.8 covers energy efficiency of mobile computing. Section 12.9 analyzes the effects of latency and presents alternative mobile computing models including cloudlets. Scale allows us to add mission-critical applications demanding very high availability, a topic discussed in Section 12.10. Scale amplifies variability often causing heavy-tail distributions of critical performance metrics as in the case of latency discussed in Section 12.11. Edge computing and Markov decision processes are analyzed in Section 12.12. Bootstrapping techniques for data analytics and approximate query processing are covered in Sections 12.13 and 12.14. Further readings and exercises and problems comprise Sections 12.15 and 12.16.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-32-385277-7.00019-1;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323852777000191;;;schema-on-write, schema-on-read, working set, data warehouse, globally distributed database, sampling-based approximate query processing, strong consistency, persistent state;Morgan Kaufmann;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Privacy in smart toys: Risks and proposed solutions;Otávio de Paula Albuquerque and Marcelo Fantinato and Judith Kelner and Anna Priscilla {de Albuquerque};Electronic Commerce Research and Applications;2020;Science@Direct;100922;39;Smart toys have become popular as technological solutions offer a better experience for children. However, the technology employed greatly increases the risks to children’s privacy, which does not seem to have become a real concern for toy makers. We investigated this issue through a study driven by two major research questions: which are the major smart toys-related children’s privacy risks and which are the major mitigation so to such risks. To answer these questions, we conducted a scoping review. As a result, we selected 26 primary studies and elaborated two classifications of risks and proposed solutions – technical and domain-specific. The most mentioned technical risk is data disclosure, while from a domain-specific perspective there is much concern on the children’s physical and psychological safety. From a mitigation standpoint, many recommendations and solutions have been proposed, but without a more common type of contribution. As a main conclusion, we observed that toy makers and privacy regulations are not yet ready regarding children’s privacy for a more active smart toys market.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2019.100922;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567422319300997;;;Internet of Toys, Connected toys, Data privacy, Children, Literature review, Scoping review;;1567-4223;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;5G network slicing using SDN and NFV: A survey of taxonomy, architectures and future challenges;Alcardo Alex Barakabitze and Arslan Ahmad and Rashid Mijumbi and Andrew Hines;Computer Networks;2020;Science@Direct;106984;167;The increasing consumption of multimedia services and the demand of high-quality services from customers has triggered a fundamental change in how we administer networks in terms of abstraction, separation, and mapping of forwarding, control and management aspects of services. The industry and the academia are embracing 5G as the future network capable to support next generation vertical applications with different service requirements. To realize this vision in 5G network, the physical network has to be sliced into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes and structures which are dedicated to different types of services based on their requirements with different characteristics and requirements (e.g., a slice for massive IoT devices, smartphones or autonomous cars, etc.). Softwarization using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)in 5G networks are expected to fill the void of programmable control and management of network resources. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and updated solutions related to 5G network slicing using SDN and NFV. Firstly, we present 5G service quality and business requirements followed by a description of 5G network softwarization and slicing paradigms including essential concepts, history and different use cases. Secondly, we provide a tutorial of 5G network slicing technology enablers including SDN, NFV, MEC, cloud/Fog computing, network hypervisors, virtual machines & containers. Thidly, we comprehensively survey different industrial initiatives and projects that are pushing forward the adoption of SDN and NFV in accelerating 5G network slicing. A comparison of various 5G architectural approaches in terms of practical implementations, technology adoptions and deployment strategies is presented. Moreover, we provide a discussion on various open source orchestrators and proof of concepts representing industrial contribution. The work also investigates the standardization efforts in 5G networks regarding network slicing and softwarization. Additionally, the article presents the management and orchestration of network slices in a single domain followed by a comprehensive survey of management and orchestration approaches in 5G network slicing across multiple domains while supporting multiple tenants. Furthermore, we highlight the future challenges and research directions regarding network softwarization and slicing using SDN and NFV in 5G networks.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2019.106984;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128619304773;;;5G, SDN, NFV, Network slicing, Cloud/edge computing, Network softwarization;;1389-1286;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Survey on blockchain based smart contracts: Applications, opportunities and challenges;Tharaka Hewa and Mika Ylianttila and Madhusanka Liyanage;Journal of Network and Computer Applications;2021;Science@Direct;102857;177;Blockchain is one of the disruptive technical innovation in the recent computing paradigm. Many applications already notoriously hard and complex are fortunate to ameliorate the service with the blessings of blockchain and smart contracts. The decentralized and autonomous execution with in-built transparency of blockchain based smart contracts revolutionize most of the applications with optimum and effective functionality. The paper explores the significant applications which already benefited from the smart contracts.

;Adaptive priority-based cache replacement and prediction-based cache prefetching in edge computing environment;Chunlin Li and Mingyang Song and Shaofeng Du and Xiaohai Wang and Min Zhang and Youlong Luo;Journal of Network and Computer Applications;2020;Science@Direct;102715;165;With the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, large amounts of data are generated at the edge of the network. Edge computing becomes a promising paradigm for the processing of large amounts of data due to its characteristics of low latency, high data throughput, and low traffic pressure. However, the increasing requirements of the novel terminal applications and services on timely content delivery. Further reducing the latency and improving the data service quality are still the challenges for the data processing. Caching strategy is an effective solution to address these issues. In order to better save the cache space of edge nodes to cache more high heat files, thereby to improve the quality of user data services, a cache replacement strategy based on priority and LRU is proposed. In this strategy, the files to be replaced are selected according to the LRU principle in each priority queue. Then the re-access weight of these files is calculated. The file with the smallest re-access weight is selected to finally be replaced. To further improve the quality of data services and reduce user access latency, a cache prefetching strategy based on Bayesian network theory is presented. This strategy selects the files to be prefetched based on the Bayesian network, and then selects edge nodes with lower loads to place these files. The proposed strategies are evaluated in an edge computing environment built over a campus network.

;Adoption of information and digital technologies for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for industry 4.0 in small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs);Li Yang and Haobo Zou and Chao Shang and Xiaoming Ye and Pratibha Rani;Technological Forecasting and Social Change;2023;Science@Direct;122308;188;An enterprise reference model in a conventional system paradigm guides users when selecting manufacturing elements, configuring the required elements into a manufacturing system, modeling the system options for evaluative processes, and comparing the system solutions with the predefined performance metrics. At present, digital innovation has a close connection with firms' sustainability. Sustainability and digital innovation are two essential components of the circular economy. In this study, an integrated decision-making framework called the q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA is developed. In this approach, the q-ROF-MEREC-RS method is applied to compute the subjective and objective weights of criteria to the adoption of information and digital technologies for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs), and the q-ROF-DNMA model is used to assess the preferences of industries over different criteria to the adoption of information and digital technologies for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs. An empirical case study to evaluate the main criteria for the adoption of information and digital technologies for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs) is taken.

;Pathways to developing information technology-enabled capabilities in born-digital new ventures;Arman Sadreddin and Yolande E. Chan;International Journal of Information Management;2023;Science@Direct;102572;68;Despite significant business opportunities made possible through advancements in technology, readily available digital technologies are often overlooked and not used by new ventures. To address this knowledge gap, this paper looks at the relationships between readily available digital technologies and born-digital new venture capabilities. We use an affordance lens to explore conditions in which born-digital new ventures interact with digital technologies to actualize digital affordances that facilitate the development of important capabilities. First, using the existing literature, we present a research model and its key elements. Then, using data on new ventures in a Canadian university incubator, we conduct fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and develop seven configurational research propositions as pathways to develop information technology-enabled organizational capabilities in new ventures. Using this retroductive approach, this research builds a context-specific middle-range theory that explains complex interactions between readily available digital technologies and new venture characteristics, where resources are provided by incubators in dynamic environments, to facilitate the development of ITOCs in the new ventures. We close by describing the study’s theoretical and practical implications.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102572;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401222001062;;;Readily available digital technology, FsQCA, IT-enabled organizational capability, Technology affordance theory, Born-digital new ventures, Digital entrepreneurship, Academic entrepreneurship, Retroductive theory building approach;;0268-4012;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A clogging resistant secure authentication scheme for fog computing services;Zeeshan Ali and Shehzad Ashraf Chaudhry and Khalid Mahmood and Sahil Garg and Zhihan Lv and Yousaf Bin Zikria;Computer Networks;2021;Science@Direct;107731;185;Fog computing (FC) is an infrastructure consisting of decentralized computing, where computing resources such as storage, applications, and data are scattered among the cloud and data source. Fog computing inherits similar privacy and security concerns present in cloud computing, such as authentication and key management issues. Recently, Wazid et al. presented a scheme of authentication key exchange for fog computing called SAKA-FC to address these issues. We analyzed and identified that the SAKA-FC suffers from some severe vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we presented an improved scheme to mitigate these problems while retaining its strengths. The formal security analysis of the proposed scheme is validated through BAN logic. At the same time, the AVISPA tool is employed for automated formal security verification. Informal security analysis is conducted to attest that the proposal can confront the known attacks. Using computation and communication costs as the metrics, the proposed scheme is also compared with some state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed scheme achieves the same communication cost as of SAKA-FC, whereas the difference in computation cost is 24%. This increase in computation cost is justifiable as the proposal is resistant to clogging attacks and provides better security than the prior schemes.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107731;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128620313219;;;Authentication, Authentication protocol, Key management, Access control, Fog computing;;1389-1286;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Chapter 14 - Overview of Blockchain Technology Concepts;C. Komalavalli and Deepika Saxena and Chetna Laroiya;;2020;Science@Direct;349-371;;Blockchain technology (BCT) has perhaps gained widespread attention around the world for roughly a decade. Since the technology was coined, researcher’s focus shifted to explore the insights of the technology. Nakamoto first introduced the concept of digital currency or cryptocurrency. Decentralized systems are the backbone of these cryptocurrencies and the technology behind these currencies are blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed ledger and one of the most promising, disruptive and revolutionary technology of today. Initially, all communities in the world believed that Bitcoin is blockchain and many myths were around what the technology is and impact of that technology in business applications. Later, an influence of core technology behind the Bitcoin had transformed the perception of the researchers, industrialists, and academicians in various domains such as Banking, Healthcare, Government, and so on. In order to know BCT in depth, the basic understanding of BCT concepts and key terms are to be explored in this chapter. Blockchain consists of chain of consecutive blocks of transactions. Traditional client/server systems are following client/server architecture and controlled by multiple administrators. But, BCT is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) network and distributed in nature. Each and every participant of the network can control the network. BCT network consists of many computers connected together and the block cannot be altered without consensus of the whole network. Block can be considered as a container for the data. Computers in the blockchain network are called nodes and each node has copy of the digital ledger. Blockchain is continuously growing chain of blocks which are interconnected and protected with the help of cryptographic functions also. Validating of new blocks is followed by a set of protocols and consensus from every participant of the network. The records are stored in linear chain. Pointers and linked list data structures are used in blockchain for the block representation. Blocks are arranged in sequence and lined with each other using linked list. Pointers are used to point the location of the next block. Block is a collection of data that stores the transaction details such as timestamp, link to the previous block which is generated by secure hash algorithm. Every block has contains two parts: block header and block body. Blockchain is characterized by consensus, distributed computation, immutability, and authentication. Since blockchain is a budding technology, different types of applications require different types of blockchains. Permissionless or public blockchain does not have any control. Anyone can read or write into the network. At the same time, permissioned ledgers are restricted to authenticated users of the network. All blocks are encrypted by a private key and cannot be interpreted by anyone. Consortium blockchains are the combination of both the public and private blockchains. With the perspective of software architecture, understanding the working model of blockchain helps in implementation of technology in different domains. In the working model of blockchain, one party initiates the transaction by creating a block. Computers in the network validate the block and finally block is added to the chain and stored across the network. Even though BCT gained momentum in the future Internet systems, number of challenges are to be addressed carefully. Expertise in BCT technology is much needed since we are in nasal stage of this technology. An adoption of BCT offers promising features in various domains, but huge initial cost for the infrastructure is a major concern for the industries. Privacy and security factors also play an important role for the implementation of BCT. Scalability and legal regulations are also posing a major challenge for the adoption of BCT.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-819816-2.00014-9;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128198162000149;;;Distributed ledger, Merkle Tree, cryptography;Academic Press;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A review on multiplatform evaluations of semi-automatic open-source based image segmentation for cranio-maxillofacial surgery;Jürgen Wallner and Michael Schwaiger and Kerstin Hochegger and Christina Gsaxner and Wolfgang Zemann and Jan Egger;Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine;2019;Science@Direct;105102;182;"Background and objectives
Computer-assisted technologies, such as image-based segmentation, play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment support in cranio-maxillofacial surgery. However, although many segmentation software packages exist, their clinical in-house use is often challenging due to constrained technical, human or financial resources. Especially technological solutions or systematic evaluations of open-source based segmentation approaches are lacking. The aim of this contribution is to assess and review the segmentation quality and the potential clinical use of multiple commonly available and license-free segmentation methods on different medical platforms.
Methods
In this contribution, the quality and accuracy of open-source segmentation methods was assessed on different platforms using patient-specific clinical CT-data and reviewed with the literature. The image-based segmentation algorithms GrowCut, Robust Statistics Segmenter, Region Growing 3D, Otsu & Picking, Canny Segmentation and Geodesic Segmenter were investigated in the mandible on the platforms 3D Slicer, MITK and MeVisLab. Comparisons were made between the segmentation algorithms and the ground truth segmentations of the same anatomy performed by two clinical experts (n = 20). Assessment parameters were the Dice Score Coefficient (DSC), the Hausdorff Distance (HD), and Pearsons correlation coefficient (r).
Results
The segmentation accuracy was highest with the GrowCut (DSC 85.6%, HD 33.5 voxel) and the Canny (DSC 82.1%, HD 8.5 voxel) algorithm. Statistical differences between the assessment parameters were not significant (p < 0.05) and correlation coefficients were close to the value one (r > 0.94) for any of the comparison made between the segmentation methods and the ground truth schemes. Functionally stable and time-saving segmentations were observed.
Conclusion
High quality image-based semi-automatic segmentation was provided by the GrowCut and the Canny segmentation method. In the cranio-maxillofacial complex, these segmentation methods provide algorithmic alternatives for image-based segmentation in the clinical practice for e.g. surgical planning or visualization of treatment results and offer advantages through their open-source availability. This is the first systematic multi-platform comparison that evaluates multiple license-free, open-source segmentation methods based on clinical data for the improvement of algorithms and a potential clinical use in patient-individualized medicine. The results presented are reproducible by others and can be used for clinical and research purposes.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105102;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260719306510;;;Multi-platform, Algorithmic, Bone segmentation, Patient-individualized medicine;;0169-2607;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Building a right digital twin with model engineering;Lin Zhang and Longfei Zhou and Berthold K.P. Horn;Journal of Manufacturing Systems;2021;Science@Direct;151-164;59;In recent years, the concept of digital twin (DT) is attracting more and more attention from researchers and engineers. But there is still no consensus on what a right DT is. On one hand, some common models are renamed as DTs. On the other hand, some DTs extremely pursue ‘the same’ as physical objects, which bring unnecessary complexities to them. In this paper, we try to answer two questions from the point of view of model engineering: how to define a right digital twin, and how to build a right digital twin. The concept and related technologies of model engineering are introduced. Some basic principles and a set of metrics for a right DT are given. An evolutionary concurrent modeling method for DT (ECoM4DT) is proposed not only inheriting the theory from classic M&S methods but also highlighting the characteristics of DT compared with traditional models to systemically guide the DT modeling process.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.02.009;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612521000455;;;Digital twin, Model engineering, Modeling and simulation, Complex system;;0278-6125;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Energy-efficient offloading for DNN-based applications in edge-cloud computing: A hybrid chaotic evolutionary approach;Zengpeng Li and Huiqun Yu and Guisheng Fan and Jiayin Zhang and Jin Xu;Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing;2024;Science@Direct;104850;187;The rapid development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) lays solid foundations for Internet of Things systems. However, mobile devices with limited processing capacity and short battery life confront the difficulties of executing complex DNNs. To satisfy different Quality of Service requirements, a feasible solution is offloading DNN layers to edge nodes and the cloud. The energy-efficient offloading problem for DNN-based applications with the deadline and budget constraints in the edge-cloud environment is still an open and challenging issue. To this end, this paper proposes a Hybrid Chaotic Evolutionary Algorithm (HCEA) incorporating diversification and intensification strategies and a DVFS-enabled version of it (HCEA-DVFS). The Archimedes Optimization Algorithm-based diversification strategy exploits global and local guiding information to improve population diversity during the updating process and employs Metropolis acceptance rule of Simulated Annealing to avoid premature convergence. The Genetic Algorithm-based chaotic intensification strategy is designed to enhance the local search capability of HCEA. Moreover, the Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling-enabled adjustment strategies can be embedded into HCEA to further reduce energy consumption by resetting frequency levels and reallocating DNN layers. Experimental results over four DNN-based applications demonstrate that HCEA-DVFS can reduce more energy consumption under different deadlines, budgets, and workloads on average by 7.93, 9.68, 11.02, 11.84, and 19.38 percent in comparison with HCEA, PSO-GA, MCEA, AOA, and Greedy, respectively.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2024.104850;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731524000145;;;Edge-cloud computing, Energy-efficient offloading, Constrained optimization, Deep neural networks, Evolutionary optimization;;0743-7315;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Secure deduplication schemes for content delivery in mobile edge computing;Yu Lin and Yunlong Mao and Yuan Zhang and Sheng Zhong;Computers & Security;2022;Science@Direct;102602;114;Since the emergence of the mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm, data leakage has become a serious threat against edge computing users, thwarting the further applications of MEC. Previous studies concentrating on data storage security and deduplication for conventional cloud computing paradigm cannot be simply adapted to edge computing because a central coordinator (for example, a cloud server) with a global view is not always available in MEC. To tackle this problem, we take the particular properties of MEC into consideration and propose secure data deduplication schemes for three MEC settings (i.e., centralized, semi-distributed and distributed settings). All of our schemes can provide secure data storage, retrieval, sharing, and deduplication. Through theoretical analysis, we prove the security of our schemes against typical attacks in outsourced data storage. Experimental results with a real-world deployment environment have showed that our schemes can guarantee service quality of MEC effectively.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2022.102602;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404822000013;;;Data security, Edge computing, Secure deduplication, Data sharing, Content delivery;;0167-4048;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Flat and hierarchical system deployment for edge computing systems;En Wang and Dawei Li and Boxiang Dong and Huan Zhou and Michelle Zhu;Future Generation Computer Systems;2020;Science@Direct;308-317;105;"In this paper, we consider the server allocation problem for edge computing system deployment where each edge cloud is modeled as an M/M/c queue. Our goal is to minimize the overall average system response time of application requests generated by all mobile devices/users. We consider two approaches for edge cloud deployment: the flat deployment, where all edge clouds are co-located with the base stations, and the hierarchical deployment, where edge clouds can be co-located with other system components besides the base stations. In flat deployment, we demonstrate that the allocation of edge cloud servers should be balanced across all the base stations, if the application request arrival rates at the base stations are equal to each other; if the application request arrival rates are not the same, we propose a Largest Weighted Reduction Time First (LWRTF) algorithm to assign servers to edge clouds. Numerical comparisons of the proposed algorithm against several other reasonably designed heuristics verify that algorithm LWRTF has very good performances in terms of minimizing the average system response time. By theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations, we also show that, the hierarchical deployment approach has great potentials in minimizing the overall average system response time compared to the flat deployment approach. We also investigate the server allocation problem in hierarchical deployment and derive important insights to guide practical edge cloud server allocation in real-world systems.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.12.004;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19304042;;;Edge computing, Edge cloud, Flat deployment, Hierarchical deployment, Average system response time;;0167-739X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;A Novel Lyapunov based Dynamic Resource Allocation for UAVs-assisted Edge Computing;Jie Lin and Lin Huang and Hanlin Zhang and Xinyu Yang and Peng Zhao;Computer Networks;2022;Science@Direct;108710;205;Mobile edge computing (MEC), as a key component in the development of IoT and 5G technologies, can provide extra computation resources in edge servers for mobile devices to complete their computation tasks with low latency and high reliability. Considerable efforts on computation offloading and resource allocation have been developed to reduce the energy consumption and computation latency in edge computing. Nonetheless, the system utility of heterogeneous edge computing system (e.g., UAVs-assisted edge computing), in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are involved in an edge computing system to serve as edge servers still needs to be further investigated. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Lyapunov based Dynamic Resource Allocation (LDRA) for UAVs-assisted Mobile Edge Computing, which can effectively choose suitable edge servers for mobile devices to offload and complete their computation tasks with low system cost and great system utility of UAVs-assisted edge computing system, as well as acceptable computation latency and great reliability for computation tasks of mobile devices. Particularly, a random queue model for edge servers is conducted in our LDRA scheme to support the dynamic of offloaded computation tasks of mobile devices. Additionally, a system cost model of UAVs-assisted edge computing is developed considering the combination of multiple constraints, such as both the mobility of UAVs and mobile devices, energy consumption, communication cost, etc. With the objective of minimizing the system cost and maximizing the system utility in providing edge resources to complete the offloaded computation tasks of mobile devices, by introducing Lyapunov optimization, a dynamic resource allocation scheme is proposed to effectively determine edge servers to offload tasks of mobile devices with considering both the real-time execution state of offloaded tasks in edge servers and states of the communication link. Through analysis and performance evaluations, our results show that our proposed LDRA scheme can achieve a great balance between system cost and system stability. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that our LDRA scheme also can achieve better system utility in comparison with existing schemes.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.108710;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128621005685;;;UAVs-assisted edge computing, Dynamic resource allocation, Lyapunov optimization, System cost and utility;;1389-1286;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;A survey of modeling language specification techniques;Dominik Bork and Dimitris Karagiannis and Benedikt Pittl;Information Systems;2020;Science@Direct;101425;87;Visual modeling languages such as the Business Process Model and Notation and the Unified Modeling Language are widely used in industry and academia for the analysis and design of information systems. Such modeling languages are usually introduced in overarching specifications which are maintained by standardization institutions such as the Object Management Group or the Open Group. Being the primary – often the single – source of information, such specifications are of paramount importance for modelers, researchers, and tool vendors. However, structure, content, and specification techniques of such documents have never been systematically analyzed. This paper addresses this gap by reporting on a Systematic Literature Review aimed to analyze published standard modeling language specifications. In total, eleven specifications were found and comprehensively analyzed. The survey reveals heterogeneity in: (i) the modeling language concepts being specified, and (ii) the techniques being employed for the specification of these concepts. The identified specification techniques are analyzed and presented by referring to their utilization in the specifications. This survey provides a foundation for research aiming to increase consistency and improve comprehensiveness of information systems modeling languages.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2019.101425;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437919303035;;;Modeling language, Specification, Metamodel, Evaluation, Standards;;0306-4379;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;An offloading method using decentralized P2P-enabled mobile edge servers in edge computing;Wenda Tang and Xuan Zhao and Wajid Rafique and Lianyong Qi and Wanchun Dou and Qiang Ni;Journal of Systems Architecture;2019;Science@Direct;1-13;94;Edge computing has emerged as a promising infrastructure for providing elastic resources in the proximity of mobile users. Owing to resource limitations in mobile devices, offloading several computational tasks from mobile devices to mobile edge servers is the main means of improving the quality of experience of mobile users. In fact, because of the high speeds of moving vehicles on expressways, there would be numerous candidate mobile edge servers available for them to offload their computational workload. However, the selection of the mobile edge server to be utilized and how much computation should be offloaded to meet the corresponding task deadlines without large computing bills are topics that have not been discussed much. Furthermore, with the increasing deployment of mobile edge servers, their centralized management would cause certain performance issues. In order to address these challenges, we firstly apply peer-to-peer networks to manage geo-distributed mobile edge servers. Secondly, we propose a new deadline-aware and cost-effective offloading approach, which aims to improve the offloading efficiency for vehicles and allows additional tasks to meet their deadlines. The proposed approach was validated for its feasibility and efficiency by means of extensive experiments, which are presented in this paper.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2019.02.001;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138376211830448X;;;Edge computing, Computation offloading, Decentralization, Deadline, Cost-effectiveness;;1383-7621;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Resource allocation and computation offloading with data security for mobile edge computing;Ibrahim A. Elgendy and Weizhe Zhang and Yu-Chu Tian and Keqin Li;Future Generation Computer Systems;2019;Science@Direct;531-541;100;With the considerable growth of mobile users (MUs) and IoT devices, complex applications and multimedia services are rapidly increasing, thereby requiring additional computations and high data communication. However, these devices are still resource-constrained with limited computation power and energy. Furthermore, security is considered a critical issue for sensitive information communication. This study presents a multiuser resource allocation and computation offloading model with data security to address the limitations of such devices. First, the computation and radio resources are jointly considered for multiuser scenarios to guarantee the efficient utilization of shared resources. In addition, an AES cryptographic technique is introduced as a security layer to protect sensitive information from cyber-attacks. Furthermore, an integrated model, which jointly considers security, computation offloading, and resource allocation, is formulated to minimize time and energy consumption of the entire system. Finally, an offloading algorithm is developed with detailed processes to determine the optimal computation offloading decision for MUs. Simulation results show that our model and algorithm can significantly improve the performance of the entire system compared with local execution and full offloading schemes.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.05.037;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X18328346;;;Computation offloading, Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile-edge computing, Optimization, Security;;0167-739X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

However, there exist several security and privacy concerns when fog nodes collaborate and share data to execute certain tasks. For example, offloading data to a malicious fog node can result into an unauthorized collection or manipulation of users’ private data. Cryptographic-based techniques can prevent external attacks, but are not useful when fog nodes are already authenticated and part of a networks using legitimate identities. We therefore resort to trust to identify and isolate malicious fog nodes and mitigate security, respectively. In this paper, we present a fog COMputIng Trust manageMENT (COMITMENT) approach that uses quality of service and quality of protection history measures from previous direct and indirect fog node interactions for assessing and managing the trust level of the nodes within the fog computing environment. Using COMITMENT approach, we were able to reduce/identify the malicious attacks/interactions among fog nodes by approximately 66%, while reducing the service response time by approximately 15 s.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2019.10.006;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731519302965;;;Fog computing, Trust, Quality of protection;;0743-7315;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Resource calendaring for Mobile Edge Computing: Centralized and decentralized optimization approaches;Bin Xiang and Jocelyne Elias and Fabio Martignon and Elisabetta {Di Nitto};Computer Networks;2021;Science@Direct;108426;199;Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a key technology for the deployment of next generation (5G and beyond) mobile networks. The computational power it provides at the edge could allow providers to fulfill the requirements of use cases in need of ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, as well as real-time access to the radio network. However, this potential needs to be carefully administered as the edge is certainly limited in terms of computation capability, as opposed to the cloud which holds the promise of a virtually infinite power. MEC nodes, though, could still try to exploit not only their local capacity, but also the one that the neighbor MEC nodes could offer. Considering that the 5G scenario assumes an ultra-dense distribution of MEC nodes, this possibility could be feasible, provided that we find an effective way to carefully allocate the resources available at each edge node. In this paper, we provide an optimization framework that considers several key aspects of the resource allocation problem with cooperating MEC nodes. We carefully model and optimize the allocation of resources, including computation and storage capacity available in network nodes as well as link capacity. Specifically, our proposed model jointly optimizes (1) the user requests admission decision (2) their scheduling, also called calendaring (3) and routing as well as (4) the decision of which nodes will serve such user requests and (5) the amount of processing and storage capacity reserved on the chosen nodes. Both an exact optimization model and an effective heuristic, based on sequential fixing, are provided. Furthermore, we propose a distributed approach for our problem, based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), so that resource allocation decisions can be made in a distributed fashion by edge nodes with limited overhead. We perform an extensive numerical analysis in several real-size network scenarios, using real positions for radio access points of a mobile operator in the Milan area. Results demonstrate that the heuristic performs close to the optimum in all considered network scenarios, while exhibiting a low computing time. This provides an evidence that our proposal is an effective framework for optimizing resource allocation in next-generation mobile networks.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.108426;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138912862100390X;;;Edge computing, Network slicing, Network design, Calendaring, Joint optimization, ADMM;;1389-1286;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Insights into security and privacy towards fog computing evolution;Sabrina Sicari and Alessandra Rizzardi and Alberto Coen-Porisini;Computers & Security;2022;Science@Direct;102822;120;The incremental diffusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and applications represents the outcome of a world ever more connected by means of heterogeneous and mobile devices. IoT scenarios imply the presence of multiple data producers (e.g., sensors, actuators, RFID, NFC) and consumers (e.g., end-user devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs). A variety of standards and protocols must cooperate to efficiently gather, process, and share the information. The fog computing paradigm, due to its distributed nature, represents a viable solution to cope with interoperability, scalability, security, and privacy issues, which naturally emerge, since it operates as an intermediate layer between data consumers/producers and traditional cloud systems. This paper analyzes the evolution in the modeling of new methodologies, related to fog computing and IoT, showing how moving security and privacy tasks toward the edge of the network provide both advantages and new challenges to be faced in this research field.

;Towards the definitive evaluation framework for cross-platform app development approaches;Christoph Rieger and Tim A. Majchrzak;Journal of Systems and Software;2019;Science@Direct;175-199;153;Mobile app development is hindered by device fragmentation and vendor-specific modifications. Boundaries between devices blur with PC-tablet hybrids on the one side and wearables on the other. Future apps need to support a host of app-enabled devices with differing capabilities, along with their software ecosystems. Prior work on cross-platform app development concerned concepts and prototypes, and compared approaches that target smartphones. To aid choosing an appropriate framework and to support the scientific assessment of approaches, an up-to-date comparison framework is needed. Extending work on a holistic, weighted set of assessment criteria, we propose what could become the definitive framework for evaluating cross-platform approaches. We have based it on sound abstract concepts that allow extensions. The weighting capabilities offer customisation to avoid the proverbial comparison of apples and oranges lurking in the variety of available frameworks. Moreover, it advises on multiple development situations based on a single assessment. In this article, we motivate and describe our evaluation criteria. We then present a study that assesses several frameworks and compares them to Web Apps and native development. Our findings suggest that cross-platform development has seen much progress but the challenges are ever growing.

In this article, we first investigate the drawbacks of wearable devices and explore the potential of addressing such drawbacks by edge computing. Then we conduct a comprehensive survey on existing works from four aspects, i.e., computation scheduling, information perception, energy-saving, and security.

In this context, a key challenge is that they typically operate in uncertain environments. Thus, an inherent requirement in sCPS design is the need to deal with the uncertainty of data coming from the environment. Existing approaches often rely on the fact that an adequate model of the environment and/or base probabilities or a prior distribution of data are available. In this paper, we present a specific logic (CB logic), which, based on statistical testing, allows specifying transition guards in architecture-based adaptation without requiring knowledge of the base probabilities or prior knowledge about the data distribution. Applicable in state machines’ transition guards in general, CB logic provides a number of operators over time series that simplify the filtering, resampling, and statistics-backed comparisons of time series, making the application of multiple statistical procedures easy for non-experts. The viability of our approach is illustrated on a running example and a case study demonstrating how CB logic simplifies adaptation triggers.

;Potential effectiveness and efficiency issues in usability evaluation within digital health: A systematic literature review;Bilal Maqbool and Sebastian Herold;Journal of Systems and Software;2024;Science@Direct;111881;208;"Context:
Digital Health (DH) is widely considered essential for sustainable future healthcare systems. Software quality, particularly usability, is crucial for the success and adoption of most DH products. However, concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of usability evaluation of DH products have been raised.
Objective:
This article aims to analyse the prevalence and application contexts of usability evaluation methods in DH and to highlight potential issues related to their effectiveness and efficiency.
Method:
A systematic literature review of usability evaluation studies, published by (academic) practitioners between 2016 and April 2023, was conducted. 610 primary articles were identified and analysed, utilising five major scientific databases.
Results:
Our findings show a preference for inquiry (85%) and testing (63%) methods, with inspection used less frequently (17%). The published studies employed methods like questionnaires (75%); notably the SUS (49%), semi-structured interviews (25%), and heuristic evaluations (73%), with percentages based on their group. Data collection mainly involved the use of participant feedback (45%), audio/video recordings (44%), and system logs (20%), with both qualitative and quantitative data analyses prevalent in studies. However, several usability characteristics such as accessibility, memorability, and operability were found to be largely overlooked, and automation tools or platforms were not widely used. Among the systems evaluated were mHealth applications (70%), telehealth platforms (36%), health information technology (HIT) solutions (29%), personalized medicine (Per. Med.) (17%), wearable devices (12%), and digital therapeutics (DTx) interventions (6%), with the participation of general users, patients, healthcare providers, and informal caregivers varying based on the health condition studied. Furthermore, insights and experiences gathered from 24 articles underscored the importance of a mixed-method approach in usability evaluations, the limitations of traditional methods, the necessity for sector-specific customisation, and the potential benefits of remote usability studies. Moreover, while eye-tracking emerged as a promising evaluation technique, careful execution and interpretation are crucial to avoid data misinterpretation.
Conclusion:
The study’s findings showed that employing a combination of inquiry and testing-based methods is prevalent for evaluating DH platforms. Despite an array of DH systems, method distribution remained consistent across platforms and targeted user groups. The study also underlines the importance of involving target user groups in the process. Potentially affected cognitive abilities of participants and potential user groups of interest have to be taken into account when choosing evaluation methods, and methods might therefore need to be tailored. Complementary inspection methods might be particularly useful when recruiting representative participants is difficult. Several potential paths for future research are outlined, such as exploring novel technologies like artificial intelligence, for improved automation tool support in the usability evaluation process.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2023.111881;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121223002765;;;Software quality, Usability evaluation method, Digital healthcare (DH), eHealth, Systematic literature review (SLR);;0164-1212;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

An Industry 4.0-enabled manufacturing environment that offers real-time data gathering, transparency and analysis across all parts of a manufacturing process is known as cyber–physical systems, also known as cyber manufacturing. Data analytics enables executives to make data-driven choices and boost productivity, while automation speeds up manufacturing and decreases machine downtime. The main objective of deploying Industry 4.0 solutions is to enable manufacturing organisations to increase collaboration by making the correct information accessible to the right people in real time. The aim of encouraging optimal decision-making at the appropriate moment is to improve efficiency and production further. The critical terms in Industry 4.0, such as the CPS, Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Twin, are widely used interchangeably in conversations about smart manufacturing. These are essential to Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing because they give users access to real-time operating data of the equipment they represent. Cyber components and physical components make up the two elements of CPS. The main aim of this paper is to brief CPS and its need for Industry 4.0. Embedded Processes and Smart 5C diagrammatically elaborate architecture of CPS for Industry 4.0. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses significant applications of CPS in Industry 4.0. For this paper, we identified and then studied relevant literature on CPS for establishing an Industry 4.0 environment. CPS is integrated into several items, including vehicles and other equipment, to carry out particular functions. CPS can be utilised in any industry, including engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and even health care, because they are all easy to use.

This work explores the dynamic complex image segmentation of self-driving vehicle under Digital Twins (DTs) based on Memory-augmented Neural Networks (MANNs), so as to further improve the performance of self-driving in intelligent transportation. In view of the complexity of the environment and the dynamic changes of the scene in intelligent transportation, this work constructs a segmentation model for dynamic complex image of self-driving vehicle under DTs based on MANNs by optimizing the Deep Learning algorithm and further combining with the DTs technology, so as to recognize the information in the environment image during the self-driving. Finally, the performance of the constructed model is analyzed by experimenting with different image datasets (PASCALVOC 2012, NYUDv2, PASCAL CONTEXT, and real self-driving complex traffic image data). The results show that compared with other classical algorithms, the established MANN-based model has an accuracy of about 85.80%, the training time is shortened to 107.00 s, the test time is 0.70 s, and the speedup ratio is high. In addition, the average algorithm parameter of the given energy function α=0.06 reaches the maximum value. Therefore, it is found that the proposed model shows high accuracy and short training time, which can provide experimental reference for future image visual computing and intelligent information processing.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2022.108956;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320322004368;;;Deep learning, Image segmentation, Memory-augmented neural networks, LSTM, Self-driving, Digital twins;;0031-3203;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Cloud Computing cannot be used for OT involving industrial applications, since it cannot guarantee stringent non-functional requirements, e.g., dependability, trustworthiness and timeliness. Instead, a new computing paradigm, called Fog Computing, is envisioned as an architectural means to realize the IT/OT convergence. In this paper we propose a Fog Computing Platform (FCP) reference architecture targeting Industrial IoT applications. The FCP is based on: deterministic virtualization that reduces the effort required for safety and security assurance; middleware for supporting both critical control and dynamic Fog applications; deterministic networking and interoperability, using open standards such as IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA); mechanisms for resource management and orchestration; and services for security, fault tolerance and distributed machine learning. We propose a methodology for the definition and the evaluation of the reference architecture. We use the Architecture Analysis Design Language (AADL) to model the FCP reference architecture, and a set of industrial use cases to evaluate its suitability for the Industrial IoT area.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2021.101727;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437921000053;;;Fog Computing, Industrial IoT, Industry 4.0, AADL, Time-Sensitive Networking, Deterministic virtualization;;0306-4379;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;PLC orchestration automation to enhance human–machine integration in adaptive manufacturing systems;Fan Mo and Miriam {Ugarte Querejeta} and Joseph Hellewell and Hamood Ur Rehman and Miren {Illarramendi Rezabal} and Jack C. Chaplin and David Sanderson and Svetan Ratchev;Journal of Manufacturing Systems;2023;Science@Direct;172-187;71;Current approaches to manufacturing must evolve to respond to increasing demands for short product life cycles and customised products. Adaptive manufacturing systems integrate advanced technologies, automation, and data-driven methodologies to develop adaptable, efficient, and responsive production processes. Central to this concept is the emphasis on human involvement and fostering synergy between human operators and the manufacturing system. Significant changes to the system’s controller are required to achieve adaptivity, with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) being a common controller type. After the necessary changes to the configuration of the manufacturing system, the PLC should be reconfigured to orchestrate the new required behaviour. Automated reconfiguration is vital to rapidly responding to change, but some changes cannot be entirely achieved without human input in collaboration with automated methods. Conventional practices in PLC programming include manual, repetitive coding practices subject to errors. As a result, to ensure operational safety, the changes must be tested before being deployed to operations, ensuring it is error-free. This paper presents a methodology to automatically reconfigure the simulation environment and controller in response to a new product request. We automate the PLC code generation and testing practices to support and free up the operators when performing repetitive manufacturing reconfiguration tasks. The methodology is based on human learning, software automation, customised program development, knowledge graphs, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The presented solution is a generic, vendor-agnostic, and interoperable solution that facilitates information exchange among multiple heterogeneous environments. Lastly, we have validated the methodology as a proof of concept at an adaptive assembly cell at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2023.07.015;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612523001474;;;PLC, Automatic program generation, Structural testing, Adaptive manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0, Knowledge graph, Graph neural network;;0278-6125;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Proof of Evaluation-based energy and delay aware computation offloading for Digital Twin Edge Network;Elif Bozkaya and Müge Erel-Özçevik and Tuğçe Bilen and Yusuf Özçevik;Ad Hoc Networks;2023;Science@Direct;103254;149;The increasing availability of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has led to the development of new technologies. Specifically, the deployment of edge servers close to IoT devices has strengthened the edge computing paradigm. With the collaboration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and cloud computing, delay-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks can be offloaded to the edge/cloud servers to improve system performance in terms of the delay and energy consumption of IoT devices. However, there is a need to schedule the computation tasks for an efficient management. More importantly, the task scheduling strategy can face data tampering attacks to deliberately modify, destroy or manipulate the decisions. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we newly propose to integrate digital twin and blockchain into the edge networks. However, it is unclear (i) how energy and delay-aware computation should be combined, and (ii) which mining computations should be executed for a secure task scheduling. The state-of-the-art focuses on task scheduling and blockchain mining, separately. Therefore, we propose a novel blockchain-based digital twin-edge network architecture where our proposed algorithm solves these two challenges at the same execution. We design a three-layer system architecture, composed of physical entity layer, digital twin edge layer and blockchain layer. In the physical entity layer, we formulate an energy and delay-aware task scheduling problem. In the digital twin edge layer, we propose a novel Proof of Evaluation (PoE)-based secure energy and delay-aware task scheduling algorithm where optimization is executed by the genetic algorithm implementation of Warehouse Location Problem (WLP). In the blockchain layer, the best-found solutions are shared with the topology in a blockchain. Here, each block includes the hash of the previous block, a genetic algorithm-based solution, nonce value, and a hash of whole blocks in the blockchain. Thus, we aim to execute the computation tasks with an acceptable delay in an energy-efficient manner and prevent data tampering attacks against the optimal computation decisions. We validate the outcomes of our PoE-based secure digital twin-edge network model with extensive evaluations. Since the proposed model distributes the task not only to the local device but also to the MEC and cloud server for delay awareness, it reduces the delay but consumes more energy. Nevertheless, the additional energy consumption can be neglected against the delay reduction. The proposed scheme is also more scalable to compare with the conventional solution. The numerical results clearly show that the proposed model provides energy and delay awareness, maintaining both data integrity and trustworthiness at the same execution of algorithm.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103254;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870523001749;;;Digital twin, Mobile edge computing, Blockchain, Proof of evaluation, Task scheduling, Energy management;;1570-8705;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Visual feedback and guided balance training in an immersive virtual reality environment for lower extremity rehabilitation;Sydney Segear and Vuthea Chheang and Lauren Baron and Jicheng Li and Kangsoo Kim and Roghayeh Leila Barmaki;Computers & Graphics;2024;Science@Direct;103880;119;Balance training is essential for physical rehabilitation procedures, as it can improve functional mobility and enhance cognitive coordination. However, conventional balance training methods may have limitations in terms of motivation, real-time objective feedback, and personalization, which a virtual reality (VR) setup may provide a better alternative. In this work, we present an immersive VR training environment for lower extremity balance rehabilitation with real-time guidance and feedback. The VR training environment immerses the user in a 3D ice rink model where a virtual coach (agent) leads them through a series of balance poses, and the user controls a trainee avatar with their own movements. We developed two coaching styles: positive-reinforcement and autonomous-supportive, and two viewpoints of the trainee avatar: first-person and third-person. The proposed environment was evaluated in a user study with healthy, non-clinical participants (n=16, 24.4 ± 5.7 years old, 9 females). Our results show that participants showed stronger performance in the positive-reinforcement style compared to the autonomous-supportive style. Additionally, in the third-person viewpoint, the participants exhibited more stability in the positive-reinforcement style compared to the autonomous-supportive style. For viewpoint, participants exhibited stronger performance in the first-person viewpoint compared to third-person in the autonomous-supportive style, while they were comparable in the positive-reinforcement style. We observed no significant effects on the foot height and number of mistakes. Furthermore, we report the analysis of user performance with balance training poses and subjective measures based on questionnaires to assess the user experience, usability, and task load. The proposed VR balance training could offer an interactive, adaptive, and engaging environment and open new potential research directions for lower extremity rehabilitation.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2024.01.007;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849324000062;;;Virtual reality, Balance training, Lower extremity rehabilitation, Guided VR training, Human-computer interaction;;0097-8493;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Applying an ensemble convolutional neural network with Savitzky–Golay filter to construct a phonocardiogram prediction model;Jimmy Ming-Tai Wu and Meng-Hsiun Tsai and Yong Zhi Huang and SK Hafizul Islam and Mohammad Mehedi Hassan and Abdulhameed Alelaiwi and Giancarlo Fortino;Applied Soft Computing;2019;Science@Direct;29-40;78;Coronary artery disease is a common chronic disease, also known as ischemic heart disease, which is a cardiac dysfunction caused by the insufficient blood supply to the heart and kills countless people every year. In recent years, coronary artery disease ranks first among the world’s top ten causes of death. Cardiac auscultation is still an important examination for diagnosing heart diseases. Many heart diseases can be diagnosed effectively by auscultation. However, cardiac auscultation relies on the subjective experience of physicians. To provide an objective diagnostic means and assist physicians in the diagnosis of heart sounds at a clinic, this study uses phonocardiograms to build an automatic classification model. This study proposes an automatic classification approach for phonocardiograms using deep learning and ensemble learning with a Savitzky–Golay filter. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is very competitive, and showed that the performance of the phonocardiogram classification model in hold out testing was 86.04% MAcc (86.46% sensitivity, 85.63% specificity), and in ten-fold cross validation it was 89.81% MAcc (91.73% sensitivity, 87.91% specificity).

;Cross domain 2D-3D descriptor matching for unconstrained 6-DOF pose estimation;Uzair Nadeem and Mohammed Bennamoun and Roberto Togneri and Ferdous Sohel and Aref {Miri Rekavandi} and Farid Boussaid;Pattern Recognition;2023;Science@Direct;109655;142;This paper presents a novel approach for cross-domain descriptor matching between 2D and 3D modalities. The 2D-3D matching is applied to localize 2D images in 3D point clouds. Direct cross-domain matching allows our technique to localize images in any type of 3D point cloud without any constraints on the nature or mechanism by which it is obtained. We propose a learning based framework, called Desc-Matcher, to directly match features between the two modalities. A dataset of 2D and 3D features with corresponding locations in images and point clouds is generated to train the Desc-Matcher. To estimate the pose of an image in any 3D cloud, keypoints and feature descriptors are extracted from the query image and the point cloud. The trained Desc-Matcher is then used to match the features from the image and the point cloud. A robust pose estimator is used to predict the location and orientation of the query image from the corresponding positions of the matched 2D and 3D features. We carried out an extensive evaluation of the proposed method for indoor and outdoor scenarios and with different types of point clouds to verify the feasibility of our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reliably estimate the 6-DOF poses of query cameras in any type of 3D point cloud with high precision.

Often these non-programmers use visual languages to specify the robot’s and/or machine’s control logic. While visual languages are explored as a means to enable novices to program, there is little understanding of what problems novices face when tasked with realistic adaptation programming tasks on the shop floor. In this paper, we report the results of a controlled experiment where domain experts in the injection molding industry inspected and changed realistic programs involving a robot, injection molding machine, and additional external machines. We found that participants were comparably quick to understand the program behavior with a familiar sequential function chart-based language and a Blockly-based language used for the first time. We also observed that these non-programmers had difficulty in multiple aspects independent of language due to the interweaving of physical and software-centric interaction between robot and machine. We conclude that assistance needs to go beyond optimizing available language elements to include suggesting relevant programming elements and their sequence.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2022.111547;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121222002230;;;Robot programming, End-user programming, Manufacturing automation, Block-based programming languages, Sequential function charts;;0164-1212;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Distributed application execution in fog computing: A taxonomy, challenges and future directions;Maria Ashraf and Muhammad Shiraz and Almas Abbasi and Saleh Albahli;Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences;2022;Science@Direct;3887-3909;34;With tremendous advancements in smart phone industry and IoT devices, edge computing has emerged to provide computational services at edge of the network. As a result, applications can be executed in a distributive manner to meet the latency requirements of applications. Despite these advancements, these devices are still considered to have limited energy, memory and computational resources compared to stationary standalone devices. Mobile edge computing extends mobile cloud computing close to end-users, decreasing latency and bandwidth utilisation by offloading tasks to edge servers. Fog computing places nodes between cloud and edge servers. A challenging approach in these paradigms is establishing offloading decision to edge/fog server, and distributed application execution at run time for heterogeneous devices. This paper reviews execution of resource-intensive tasks on mobile devices in distributed frameworks. The objective is to identify research gaps and highlight new research directions that can be pursued in future. Application execution involves application partitioning, task allocation, task execution and task resumption. In this paper, we propose a separate taxonomy for each step in application execution, reviews state-of-the-art techniques, and analyses critical aspects of application execution in a distributed manner.

;Modelling and transposition of location-based games;Cristiane Ferreira and Luís Fernando Maia and Carlos {de Salles} and Fernando Trinta and Windson Viana;Entertainment Computing;2019;Science@Direct;100295;30;Design and development of Location-Based Games (LBG) are not trivial tasks due to their pervasive nature, multidisciplinary requirements, and global deployment issues. This paper presents a model-based approach to describe and generate LBGs. Our approach separates location data, game mechanics, and media content from the game implementation. We aim at allowing LBGs to be edited and deployed in many places quickly. The core is LeGaL, an extension of NCL (Nested Context Language) that models and represents the game structure and its multimedia contents (e.g., video, 3D objects). Its novel approach allows the modelling of mission-based games by supporting relationships between game elements and multimedia documents. We also present a transposition method that provides for LBGs to be deployed around distinct cities in the world by generating balanced game maps. To validate this approach, we applied map balancing measurements to compare the transposed map of an LBG. Additionally, we implemented an authoring tool and a game server that enabled us to model, generate, and to map LBGs. We assessed LeGaL using a qualitative evaluation with six NCL developers. Positive results indicate that our model-based approach has the potential to improve the design and development of LBGs.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2019.100295;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187595211830017X;;;Location-based games, Game modelling, Game map transposition, NCL;;1875-9521;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;A robust brain pattern for brain-based authentication methods using deep breath;Fares Yousefi and Hoshang Kolivand;Computers & Security;2023;Science@Direct;103520;135;Security authentication involves the process of verifying a person's identity. Authentication technology has played a crucial role in data security for many years. However, existing typical biometric authentication technologies exhibit limitations related to usability, time efficiency, and notably, the long-term viability of the method. Recent technological advancements have led to the development of specific devices capable of reproducing human biometrics due to their visibility and tactile nature. Consequently, there is a demand for a new biometric method to address the limitations of current authentication systems. Human brain signals have been utilized in various Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Nevertheless, this approach also faces challenges related to usability, time efficiency, and most importantly, the stability of the method over time. Studies reveal that the stability of brain patterns poses a significant challenge in EEG-based authentication techniques. Stability refers to the capacity to withstand changes or disruptions, while permanency implies a lasting and unchanging state. Notably, stability can be temporary and subject to fluctuations, whereas permanency suggests a more enduring condition. Research demonstrates that utilizing alpha brainwaves is a superior option for authentication compared to other brainwave types. Many brain states lack stability in different situations. Interestingly, deep breathing can enhance alpha waves irrespective of the brain's current state. To explore the potential of utilizing deep breathing as a security pattern for authentication purposes, an experiment was conducted to investigate its effects on brain activity and its role in enhancing alpha brainwaves. By focusing on bolstering the permanency of brain patterns, our aim is to address the challenges associated with stability in EEG-based authentication techniques. The experimental results exhibited a high success rate of 91 % and 90 % for Support Vector Machine and Neural Network classifiers, respectively. These results suggest that deep breathing not only enhances permanency but could also serve as a suitable option for a brainwave-based authentication method.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103520;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823004303;;;BCI, Brain-based authentication, Brain-computer interface, Brain state stability, EEG signal;;0167-4048;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

However, the term IoT and CPS are new in the GIS realm. This article reviews the concepts of IoT and CPS from the perspective of geospatial spaces and proposes the concept of Geo CPS to develop the potential of new technology in the geographic dimension. Two forms of Geo CPS are discussed: pseudo-CPS (PCPS), which projects spatial data onto a display without interaction among data sources, and true-CPS (TCPS), which handles data sources deeply and semantically. While PCPS already has wide industrial applications, TCPS is still in its infancy. The spatial challenge for CPS in geo space involves operating conditions in an open environment, and here, the human-machine system interface will be key. A transformation of our mindset relating to GIS can lead to the creation of new value-added geographical information services. This will require new schemes and platforms for data sharing, processing, security, and privacy, etc.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jum.2019.09.005;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2226585619301293;;;Internet of things (IoT), Space integration, Cyber-physical systems (CPS), Sensing, Processing and Accutation (SPA);;2226-5856;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;A privacy calculus model for contact tracing apps: Analyzing the use behavior of the German Corona-Warn-App with a longitudinal user study;David Harborth and Sebastian Pape;Computers & Security;2023;Science@Direct;103338;132;The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a pressing societal issue today. The German government promotes a contract tracing app named Corona-Warn-App (CWA), aiming to change citizens’ health behaviors during the pandemic by raising awareness about potential infections and enable infection chain tracking. Technical implementations, citizens’ perceptions, and public debates around apps differ between countries, e. g., in Germany there has been a huge discussion on potential privacy issues of the app. Thus, we analyze effects of privacy concerns regarding the CWA, perceived CWA benefits, and trust in the German healthcare system to answer why citizens use the CWA. In our initial conference publication at ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection – 37th IFIP TC 11 International Conference, SEC 2022, we used a sample with 1752 actual users and non-users of the CWA and and support for the privacy calculus theory, i. e., individuals weigh privacy concerns and benefits in their use decision. Thus, citizens privacy perceptions about health technologies (e. g., shaped by public debates) are crucial as they can hinder adoption and negatively affect future fights against pandemics. In this special issue, we adapt our previous work by conducting a second survey 10 months after our initial study with the same pool of participants (830 participants from the first study participated in the second survey). The goal of this longitudinal study is to assess changes in the perceptions of users and non-users over time and to evaluate the influence of the significantly lower hospitalization and death rates on the use behavior which we could observe during the second survey. Our results show that the privacy calculus is relatively stable over time. The only relationship which significantly changes over time is the effect of privacy concerns on the use behavior which significantly decreases over time, i. e., privacy concerns have a lower negative effect one the CWA use indicating that it did not play such an important role in the use decision at a later point in time in the pandemic. We contribute to the literature by introducing one of the rare longitudinal analyses in the literature focusing on the privacy calculus and changes over time in the relevant constructs as well as the relationships between the calculus constructs and target variables (in our case use behavior of a contact tracing app). We can see that the explanatory power of the privacy calculus model is relatively stable over time even if strong externalities might affect individual perceptions related to the model.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103338;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823002481;;;Covid-19, Contact tracing apps, Information privacy, Longitudinal user study, Health-app adoption;;0167-4048;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Chapter Five - The edge AI paradigm: Technologies, platforms and use cases;Pethuru Raj and J. Akilandeswari and M. Marimuthu;;2022;Science@Direct;139-182;127;Two of the most interesting topics in the technology world today are edge computing and artificial intelligence (Ai). Individually each of them has done exceedingly well in contributing for the betterment of the society. Now if they converge, we can solidly expect a paradigm shift and the impacts will be mesmerizingly profound and phenomenal. The fusion of these two popular technologies is laying down a spectacular foundation for creating new kinds of experiences and opportunities for people. Newer possibilities can easily come up across business verticals. There will be premium and people-centric services emerging and evolving for automating and accelerating a number of manual activities in our daily lives. This unique combination can result in fructifying the longstanding demand of people IT. These also smoothen the path and clear the route for the age-old transition from business IT to people IT. This convergence directly influences peoples' lives in a distinguishing and deft manner. This can save time, improve privacy, reduce network traffic, and enable applications or devices to be optimized for specific environments. Precisely speaking, the convergence of these two strategically sound technologies can bring forth noteworthy advancements and accomplishments for the total society. In this chapter, we are to see how this unique linkage is going to be hugely beneficial for institutions, individuals and innovators. The union is being termed as “Edge AI.”;;https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.adcom.2022.02.003;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065245822000328;;;Edge computing, Edge data analytics, Edge device clouds, Artificial intelligence, Edge AI;Elsevier;0065-2458;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Zooming in and out the landscape: Artificial intelligence and system dynamics in business and management;Stefano Armenia and Eduardo Franco and Francesca Iandolo and Giuliano Maielli and Pietro Vito;Technological Forecasting and Social Change;2024;Science@Direct;123131;200;Organizations are increasingly leveraging the ability of artificial intelligence to analyze and resolve complex problems. This can potentially reshape the interdependencies and interactions of complex systems, leading to our research question: To what extent and in which direction is the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and System Dynamics (SD) converging within the business and management landscape? We conducted an extensive literature review using bibliometric and topic modeling methods to address this question. Through a bibliometric analysis, we identified the areas in which academic papers referred to both SD and AI literature. However, bibliometrics do not show a clear path towards convergence. The top modeling analysis highlights more details on how convergence is structured, providing insights into how SD and AI may be integrated. Two trajectories are identified. In the “soft convergence,” AI supports system dynamics analysis and modeling more deeply characterized by social interaction. In the “hard convergence,” AI shapes innovative ways of rethinking system design, dynamics, and interdependencies. Our analysis suggests that while soft convergence is more visible in the business and management landscape, hard convergence may well represent a new frontier in studying system dynamics with the potential to reshape the landscape.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123131;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523008168;;;System dynamics, Artificial intelligence, Bibliometrics, Topic modeling, Technology, Forecasting;;0040-1625;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Maturity level assessments of information security controls: An empirical analysis of practitioners assessment capabilities;Christopher Schmitz and Michael Schmid and David Harborth and Sebastian Pape;Computers & Security;2021;Science@Direct;102306;108;Maturity models are a widely used concept for measuring information security. The idea is to systematically evaluate the maturity of security-relevant processes in an organisation. This enables decision-makers to get an overview of the implementation status of relevant processes to identify neuralgic points. Maturity models thus play a central role in the conception of information security management systems (ISMS). Some industries, for instance, the German automotive industry, have even established security maturity levels as the de facto standard for measuring information security. However, the quality of security maturity level assessments has not been sufficiently investigated yet. Therefore, we have analysed to what extent security managers can accurately assess the maturity levels of security controls. To verify the quality of maturity level assessments a case study was conducted where security experts assessed a subset of the ISO/IEC 27002 security controls for a hypothetical scenario using the COBIT maturity levels. Additionally, ex-post interviews have been conducted with several participants of the study to verify some of the hypotheses developed during the previous analyses. Our results show that many security experts struggled with the task and did not perform well. However, we discovered professional characteristics that have a strong significant effect on the assessment capabilities. We also identified various types of additional support that can help practitioners to make more reliable assessments in practice. Moreover, the experts' self-perception was overly optimistic when asked to assess their performance. We even found a weak inverted correlation for more experienced experts, also known as Dunning-Kruger effect. Our results have a strong impact on practice since they indicate that practitioners need support to carry out high-quality assessments and they also show what kind of support addresses the identified challenges.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102306;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404821001309;;;Usability evaluation, Security controls, Maturity levels, ISO 27002, COBIT;;0167-4048;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;An evaluation method of channel state information fingerprinting for single gateway indoor localization;Brieuc Berruet and Oumaya Baala and Alexandre Caminada and Valery Guillet;Journal of Network and Computer Applications;2020;Science@Direct;102591;159;The proliferation of location-based services highlights the need to develop an accurate indoor localization solution. The global navigation satellite system does not deliver good accuracy indoors because of weak signal. One solution is to piggyback Wi-Fi technology, which is widespread in offices and domestic environments. This wireless communication has a promising future, with the possibility to estimate locations with a single gateway by combining channel state information with fingerprinting. However, the existing solutions are often limited to a specific setup and are hard to replicate in other situations. Furthermore, channel state information consists of complex data, which hampers the learning phase of machine learning techniques. This paper assesses the performances of unsupervised data complexity reduction methods by considering different data collection scenarios with multiple antenna elements at the anchor gateway. The study puts forward an evaluation method based on five heuristic scores to guide the design of future fingerprinting solutions based on channel state information. This has been extended to several spatial distributions of training locations, and we show that the kernel entropy component analysis is more suitable for implementation than the principal component analysis, the factor analysis, the independent component analysis and the kernel principal component analysis.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102591;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804520300655;;;Performance assessment, CSI Fingerprinting, Indoor localization, Single gateway, Unsupervised data complexity reduction, SIMO, Data collection scenarios;;1084-8045;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Towards Multimodal Information Systems for Assisting Humans in Production and Logistics Processes;Axel Börold and Dirk Schweers and Michael Freitag;Procedia CIRP;2023;Science@Direct;1089-1094;120;Information support systems for coping with and mastering increasing process complexity are becoming a success factor for many companies. The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements. Based on the findings, a concept for an stationary adaptive multimodal information system was developed, which, to our knowledge, does not exist yet due to the combination of a 2D/3D scanner and conversational intelligence and can be used to improve human-machine interaction in the context of Industry 5.0.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.09.130;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827123008624;;;Keywords, Industry 5.0, Information Systems, Cognitive Assistance, Human Computer Interface;;2212-8271;;56th CIRP International Conference on Manufacturing Systems 2023;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Relation-balanced graph convolutional network for 3D human pose estimation;Lu Chen and Qiong Liu;Image and Vision Computing;2023;Science@Direct;104841;140;Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been applied to 2D-to-3D human pose estimation (HPE) and have shown encouraging performance. However, existing GCNs model the relations between joints via individual kernels, which can be overly flexible and fail to capture common relational patterns due to the symmetric nature of the human body. Although some GCNs share kernels to capture common relations, the unified way for all neighbors limits relational diversity to some extent. In order to balance the diversity and commonality of relations, we conduct a comprehensive study of existing kernel-sharing strategies and propose a Relation-balanced Graph Convolutional Network (RbGC-Net). RbGC-Net introduces the Part-Specific Kernel-Sharing strategy (PSKS) that assigns kernels based on the semantic meanings of neighbors to establish specific relational patterns for different types of neighborhoods. Furthermore, RbGC-Net incorporates a Local–Global Feature Fusion module (LGFF) that extracts the local relations among joints and balances them with the final global relations to improve the interactions between joints. Compared with state-of-the-art methods for 3D HPE, our RbGC-Net achieves the optimal balance between model size and estimation errors. Results on two benchmark Human3.6 M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate the excellent performance and strong generalization ability of our pure GCN-based method.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imavis.2023.104841;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885623002159;;;3D human pose estimation, Graph convolutional network, Relation modeling, Feature fusion;;0262-8856;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

It is widely used in games and is also becoming a reality in other domains. Research indicates that the characteristics of a person’s avatar can influence his/her behavior while using a system, improving the sense of presence, immersion, and self-expression. A gap is how to support developers proposing avatar personalization, considering a user’s context, and understanding how context-awareness applied to avatars influences self-expression. In this article, we investigate how to support the development of self-expressive avatars. We present VISHnu, an approach developed to support the formalization of the use of context for avatar personalization. We conducted three evaluations to investigate the potential and feasibility of the VISHnu approach with specialists and developers: a focus group (n = 6), interviews (n = 6), and a questionnaire (n = 12).

;The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research;Jonna Koivisto and Juho Hamari;International Journal of Information Management;2019;Science@Direct;191-210;45;Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) could extract knowledge from this audiovisual data but they typically require large amounts of resources (processing power, memory and energy). If all limitations of the execution environment are known beforehand, we can design neural networks under these constraints. An IoT setting however is a very heterogeneous environment where the constraints can change rapidly. We propose a technique allowing us to deploy a variety of different networks at runtime, each with a specific complexity-accuracy trade-off but without having to store each network independently.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) has enabled substantial productivity gains in the Architecture, Engineering, & Construction (AEC) sector. However, BIM has only been marginally adopted in the execution phase of conventional tunneling projects. For this purpose, we propose a BIM model that facilitates fully digital and automated data exchange between project stakeholders. We use the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a basis and identify concepts potentially useful to represent data from the execution phase of construction projects. We demonstrate how IFC concepts are utilized to represent a shift report of a conventional tunneling project. Thereby, we deliver a reference model as an implementation guide for software developers in this domain. This may serve as a blueprint for handling construction management data in a machine-readable format, laying the foundations for Big Open BIM in the execution phase of construction projects.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tust.2023.105368;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0886779823003887;;;BIM, IFC, Tunneling, Construction phase, Process, Labor, Equipment, Material, Digitalization;;0886-7798;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;An end-to-end framework for unconstrained monocular 3D hand pose estimation;Sanjeev Sharma and Shaoli Huang;Pattern Recognition;2021;Science@Direct;107892;115;This work addresses the challenging problem of unconstrained 3D hand pose estimation using monocular RGB images. Most of the existing approaches assume some prior knowledge of hand (such as hand locations and side information) is available for 3D hand pose estimation. This restricts their use in unconstrained environments. Therefore, we present an end-to-end framework that robustly predicts hand prior information and accurately infers 3D hand pose by learning ConvNet models while only using keypoint annotations. To enhance the hand detector’s robustness, we propose a novel keypoint-based method to simultaneously predict hand regions and side labels, unlike existing methods that suffer from background color confusion caused by using segmentation or detection-based technology. Moreover, inspired by the human hand’s biological structure, we introduce two geometric constraints directly into the 3D coordinates prediction that further improves its performance. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-art methods on standard benchmark datasets while providing robust predictions.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.107892;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321000790;;;Hand detection, Hand tracking, Hand pose estimation, Computer vision, Deep learning;;0031-3203;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;AI system architecture design methodology based on IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure for successful AI adoption in organizations;Seungkyu Park and Joong yoon Lee and Jooyeoun Lee;Data & Knowledge Engineering;2024;Science@Direct;102264;150;With the advancement of AI technology, the successful AI adoption in organizations has become a top priority in modern society. However, many organizations still struggle to articulate the necessary AI, and AI experts have difficulties understanding the problems faced by these organizations. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for organizations to identify the technical requirements, such as necessary data and algorithms, for adopting AI. To overcome this problem, we propose a new AI system architecture design methodology based on the IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure. The IMO structure enables effective identification of the technical requirements necessary to develop real AI models. While previous research has identified the importance and challenges of technical requirements, such as data and AI algorithms, for AI adoption, there has been little research on methodology to concretize them. Our methodology is composed of three stages: problem definition, system AI solution, and AI technical solution to design the AI technology and requirements that organizations need at a system level. The effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through a case study, logical comparative analysis with other studies, and experts reviews, which demonstrate that our methodology can support successful AI adoption to organizations.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2023.102264;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X23001246;;;AI(Artificial intelligence), AI system architecture design, System engineering, Requirements engineering, AI adoption;;0169-023X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;A knowledge management system for sharing knowledge about cultural heritage projects;Néstor A. Nova and Rafael A. González and Lina C. Beltrán and Carlos E. Nieto;Journal of Cultural Heritage;2023;Science@Direct;61-70;63;Cultural Heritage Projects (CHP) are complex activities that involve multiple and heterogeneous actors attempting to harmonize their different and diverse ontological and epistemological perspectives, while simultaneously coordinating and sharing knowledge about heritage objects. Projects involve a multitude of related data, information, and knowledge, and require information technologies for coordination. In this context, the socio-technical approach to designing information systems (IS) has become widely adopted but it is contradictory in knowledge coordination scenarios in which heritage experts and coordination technologies form inseparable sociomaterial assemblages that evolve through routines and affordances, depending on the contextual dimensions of particular projects. This paper adopts a design science approach to present the sociomaterial design of a Knowledge Management System (KMS) for cultural heritage projects. The KMS aims to overcome coordination issues for sharing knowledge within and between heritage projects. Evaluation results outline that the KMS provides enhanced knowledge access and visualization, greater flexibility in sharing practices, and improved decision-making capabilities. The designed system meets the specific requirements of an international knowledge sharing network and introduces innovative design and coordination insights that can be successfully deployed in heritage projects and networks with similar coordination and collaborative features.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.culher.2023.07.013;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207423001358;;;Cultural heritage, Knowledge management system, Knowledge sharing, Coordination, Sociomateriality, Design science;;1296-2074;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

The mixture variations, such as partial overlap, noise and cross sources, are the root cause of these large outliers. Existing methods face challenges in effectively removing the large outliers. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework to remove the outliers by detecting the accurate inlier correspondences. Specifically, our coarse module predicts the top-K accurate correspondences. The coarse module is trained by jointly leveraging global and local structured information. Then, our refinement module checks the correspondences further using our proposed novel higher-order filter, which enables the structure conformity of correspondences to improve the quality of inlier correspondences. The final transformation matrix is calculated by using the refined inlier correspondences. Furthermore, a new cross-source point cloud dataset is proposed to further demonstrate the robustness in real-world point clouds.

;Why do consumers adopt smart voice assistants for shopping purposes? A perspective from complexity theory;Dimah Al-Fraihat and Maram Alzaidi and Mike Joy;Intelligent Systems with Applications;2023;Science@Direct;200230;18;The widespread appeal of Smart Voice Assistants (SVAs) stems from their ability to enhance the everyday lives of consumers in a practical, enjoyable, and meaningful manner. Despite their popularity, the factors that shape consumer adoption of SVAs remain largely unexplored. To address this research gap, we utilized complexity theory to construct an integrated model that sheds light on the determinants of consumer decision-making in regard to SVA adoption. Furthermore, we applied fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to examine the proposed model and uncover the causal recipes associated with SVA adoption. Our necessary condition analysis highlights that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived humanness, and perceived social presence are necessary predictors for consumers' intentions to adopt SVA. This study constitutes a significant addition to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the drivers of SVA adoption. Moreover, it offers crucial implications for online service provider managers to improve the adoption of SVAs among their customers.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iswa.2023.200230;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667305323000558;;;Smart voice assistants, Complexity theory, fsQCA, SVA adoption, Functional and social variables;;2667-3053;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

First, we encode the depth images into three channels using the HHA representation to obtain the similar structure to the RGB images. Second, a multi-modal fusing features learning FCN with attention model is constructed, which can extract hierarchical multi-modal fusing features of the samples in RGB-D data. The attention model is adopted to exploit the importance weight of RGB and depth to fuse the features of the two modalities at multiple layers effectively, rather than concatenating the feature vectors of the two channels simply. Finally, the hierarchical multi-modal fusing features of the samples are input to the Efficient Convolution Operators (ECO) tracker, and the update strategy is improved by the occlusion detection in the depth images. Experimental results datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D tracker achieves new state-of-art performance on the large-scale Princeton RGB-D Tracking Benchmark (PTB) dataset and the University of Birmingham RGB-D Tracking Benchmark (BTB).;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2018.09.014;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253517306784;;;RGB-D tracking, Hierarchical multi-modal feature fusion FCN, Attention model, ECO tracker;;1566-2535;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Implementing Virtuality in Production - a Design Science Approach;Manuel Brunner and Herbert Jodlbauer and Nadine Bachmann and Shailesh Tripathi;Procedia Computer Science;2023;Science@Direct;988-997;217;The trend toward smart production is omnipresent in research over recent years and there are different approaches how to making a production smart. One of these approaches is to enrich reality with virtual aspects. Alongside the efforts to make production smarter by implementing augmented and virtual reality devices arise the challenges like motion sickness, usability, the weight of devices, or simply the complexity of the implementation process. A forced implementation of smart applications could lead to the frustration of the applicants and ruin the fruitful ground for improvement. The right position for the implementation of virtuality measures as well as the right dose of implementation is essential for success. This paper aims to connect an existing comprehensive approach with the implementation process of virtuality in production and show that such a scientific-based approach supports such a task. Design science research offers an existing, well-elaborated framework for complex tasks and bears the potential to support a virtuality implementation process. This led to the research question: Does design science as an existing research framework support the virtuality implementation process in production? Design science defines the environment of application as characterized by people (in different roles and capabilities) an organization (with different processes and structures) and technologies (like infrastructure and communication). This environment could be seen as the production environment. Further, we do have a broad knowledge base due to the profound work of the academic community in the field of augmented and virtual reality and a huge methodological toolbox. The existing environment and knowledge base are the basements to create an artifact, evaluate, and reshaping it. With this paper, we suggest a design science research-based procedure to support the implementation of virtuality in production. Design science research comes out from information science and is more and more applied in other research fields. As a result of our work, we saw that following a structured approach like the design science approach has the potential to support companies to successfully implement virtuality measures in production.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.297;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050922023754;;;Virtuality, Implementation, Support, Production, Design Science;;1877-0509;;4th International Conference on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Firstly, since multi-orientation features are among the key visual stimuli in the human visual system (HVS) to perceive object spatial information, discrete wavelet frame transform (DWDT) is applied to extract directionality characteristics for calculating the centoid of remarkable objects in the original image. Then, the color contrast feature is used to represent the physical characteristics of salient objects. Thirdly, in order to explore and utilize the background features of an input image, sparse dictionary learning is performed to statistically analyze and estimate the background feature map. Finally, three distinctive cues of the directional feature including the color contrast feature and the background feature are combined to generate a final robust saliency map. Experimental results on three widely used image datasets show that our proposed method is effective and efficient, and is superior to other state-of-the-art saliency-detection models.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114219;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420309441;;;Discrete wavelet transform, Saliency detection, Background features, Position prior;;0957-4174;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;The future of the technology-based manufacturing in the European Union;Awadesh Kumar Mallik;Results in Engineering;2023;Science@Direct;101356;19;The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2023.101356;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590123023004838;;;Manufacturing, EU, Carbon-neutrality, Digitalization, Management;;2590-1230;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;A holistic approach for cross-platform software development;J.Z. Blanco and D. Lucrédio;Journal of Systems and Software;2021;Science@Direct;110985;179;Cross-platform development solutions can help to make software available on different devices and platforms. But these are normally restricted to preconfigured platforms and consider that each individual solution is equal or similar to each other. As a result, developers have to resort to native development and build individual solutions, one for each device/platform, that cooperate to deliver the desired global functionality. This article presents an approach that takes advantage of existing solutions and have support for extending and including new platforms, and distributing functionality across devices. The approach is based on a general-purpose language that raises the abstraction level in order to keep the software free from platform details. Automatic transformations produce executable code that can be properly divided and deployed separately into different platforms. The proposed approach was evaluated in four ways. In the first evaluation, an existing cross-platform system was recreated using the approach. The second and third evaluations was conducted with expert and novice developers, who tested the approach in practice. The fourth evaluation introduced support for cross-platform testing. Results have brought evidence supporting the following main contributions: use of a single environment, the ability to reuse similar concepts between platforms and the potential to reduce costs.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.110985;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121221000820;;;Cross-platform development, General-purpose language, Model-driven development, User studies;;0164-1212;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Point attention network for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds;Mingtao Feng and Liang Zhang and Xuefei Lin and Syed Zulqarnain Gilani and Ajmal Mian;Pattern Recognition;2020;Science@Direct;107446;107;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have performed extremely well on data represented by regularly arranged grids such as images. However, directly leveraging the classic convolution kernels or parameter sharing mechanisms on sparse 3D point clouds is inefficient due to their irregular and unordered nature. We propose a point attention network that learns rich local shape features and their contextual correlations for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. Since the geometric distribution of the neighboring points is invariant to the point ordering, we propose a Local Attention-Edge Convolution (LAE-Conv) to construct a local graph based on the neighborhood points searched in multi-directions. We assign attention coefficients to each edge and then aggregate the point features as a weighted sum of its neighbors. The learned LAE-Conv layer features are then given to a point-wise spatial attention module to generate an interdependency matrix of all points regardless of their distances, which captures long-range spatial contextual features contributing to more precise semantic information. The proposed point attention network consists of an encoder and decoder which, together with the LAE-Conv layers and the point-wise spatial attention modules, make it an end-to-end trainable network for predicting dense labels for 3D point cloud segmentation. Experiments on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds show that our algorithm can perform at par or better than the existing state of the art methods.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107446;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320320302491;;;Semantic segmentation, 3D point cloud, Point attention network, Deep learning;;0031-3203;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Second, the depth maps predicted by feature maps with different resolutions contain different critical information. The lower-resolution depth maps play an overall role in predicting the overall contour; the higher-resolution depth map is more accurate in predicting object edge details.

;Session persistence for dynamic web applications in Named Data Networking;Xiuquan Qiao and Pei Ren and Junliang Chen and Wei Tan and M. Brian Blake and Wangli Xu;Journal of Network and Computer Applications;2019;Science@Direct;220-235;125;Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising future network architecture. It greatly facilitates static Web content distribution due to its information-centric communication paradigm, novel in-network caching, and name-based routing features. However, NDN still lacks efficient support for dynamic Web applications. Specifically, the inefficient communications are attributed to inherent features of NDN, such as its being multisource and multicast, as well as its decoupling of content from location. A dynamic Web request generally includes dozens of Interest packets. Since NDN lacks efficient support for the session persistence of dynamic Web applications, existing name-based forwarding strategies cannot effectively forward those Interest packets that belong to the same session to the specific server in cases where multiple server clusters are deployed by the Application Service Provider (ASP). This, therefore, leads to the packet retransmission problem: retransmitted Interest packets waste network resources and degrade the performance of dynamic Web applications. How to effectively maintain session persistence is worth considering for an NDN network. To this end, we design and implement a system framework that aims to enhance dynamic Web applications over NDN through a session-oriented approach. First, we propose a session-based forwarding model that maintains a virtual connection during an online interaction. Second, we design a robust forwarding scheme that can balance the dynamic content traffic with a fault recovery capability. Finally, we implement our approach and conduct experiments on the ndnSIM, network topology in the simulation is designed based on the China Education and Research Network 2.

This work explores the dynamic complex image segmentation of self-driving vehicle under Digital Twins (DTs) based on Memory-augmented Neural Networks (MANNs), so as to further improve the performance of self-driving in intelligent transportation. In view of the complexity of the environment and the dynamic changes of the scene in intelligent transportation, this work constructs a segmentation model for dynamic complex image of self-driving vehicle under DTs based on MANNs by optimizing the Deep Learning algorithm and further combining with the DTs technology, so as to recognize the information in the environment image during the self-driving. Finally, the performance of the constructed model is analyzed by experimenting with different image datasets (PASCALVOC 2012, NYUDv2, PASCAL CONTEXT, and real self-driving complex traffic image data). The results show that compared with other classical algorithms, the established MANN-based model has an accuracy of about 85.80%, the training time is shortened to 107.00 s, the test time is 0.70 s, and the speedup ratio is high. In addition, the average algorithm parameter of the given energy function α=0.06 reaches the maximum value. Therefore, it is found that the proposed model shows high accuracy and short training time, which can provide experimental reference for future image visual computing and intelligent information processing.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2022.108956;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320322004368;;;Deep learning, Image segmentation, Memory-augmented neural networks, LSTM, Self-driving, Digital twins;;0031-3203;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;What about the usability in low-code platforms? A systematic literature review;Daniel Pinho and Ademar Aguiar and Vasco Amaral;Journal of Computer Languages;2023;Science@Direct;101185;74;"Context:
Low-code development is a concept whose presence has grown both in academia and the software industry and is discussed alongside others, such as model-driven engineering and domain-specific languages. Usability is an important concept in low-code contexts since users of these tools often lack a background in programming. Grey literature articles have also stated that low-code tools have high usability.
Objective:
This paper examines the current literature about low-code and no-code to discover more about them and their relationship with usability, particularly its quality, which factors are the most relevant, and how users view these tools. This focus on usability aims to provide a different point of view from other works on low-code.
Method:
We performed a systematic literature review based on a formal protocol for this study. The search protocol returned a total of 207 peer-review articles across five databases, which was supplemented with a snowballing process. These were filtered using inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 38 relevant articles that were analysed, synthesised and reported.
Conclusion:
Despite growing interest and a strong enterprise presence in academia, we did not find a formal definition of low-code, although common characteristics have been specified. We found that users have a heightened awareness of usability regarding low-code tools, with some authors performing feasibility studies on their implementations or listing factors that influence the user experience in a given tool. Researchers are considering usability factors unconsciously, and the low-code field would grow if research on usability increased. This paper also suggests a definition for low-code development.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cola.2022.101185;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259011842200082X;;;Low-code development, Usability, Model-driven engineering, User experience;;2590-1184;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;What is Virtual Reality? A healthcare-focused systematic review of definitions;Jonathan R Abbas and Alexander O'Connor and Eshwar Ganapathy and Rachel Isba and Antony Payton and Brendan McGrath and Neil Tolley and Iain A Bruce;Health Policy and Technology;2023;Science@Direct;100741;12;"Objectives
There has been significant advancement in virtual reality (VR) technology since its conception in 1960, and this evolution has particularly accelerated in recent years. Alongside this, we are seeing an expansion of research interest within which the definitions and nomenclature can be complex and lead to potential misunderstanding or confusion. We present a systematic review of definitions of the term VR as reported within the medical literature with the aim to establish the terminology used to define VR, the differences that exist through the literature, and if they have changed over time.
Methods
By reporting according to the PRISMA guidelines, we present a systematic review of VR definitions in the English language medical literature. The databases Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched using the search terms ‘virtual reality’, ‘definition’, ‘defined’, or ‘define’. Articles were included if they were peer-reviewed, within the medical literature, published between 22nd December 2001 and 22nd December 2021, and offered either an original or cited definition for the term VR. Following data extraction, quantitative analysis of terminology over time and term density maps have been created.
Results
Eighty-eight studies were included offering 105 definitions of the term VR. Of these articles, 58 were published within the last 5 years. Common terms when defining VR included ‘computer’, ‘environment’, ‘user’, ‘interactive’ and ‘simulation’. In recent years, a novel term ‘head mounted display’ has emerged which was not previously featured in healthcare literature.
Conclusions
This systematic review highlights that the published literature in the field of VR is rapidly expanding. With the growth in technology we can see a complex network of terminology emerge with little homogeneity. Definitions of VR are numerable and high variability exists. We recommend the requirement for consensus in order to urgently unify terminology within the immersive technology field, and whilst waiting for agreement, an evidence-based definition for VR has been suggested.
Public interest summary
A systematic review of the literature has been performed to better understand the terminology that academic authors have used to define what virtual reality technology is. This review concluded that a wide range of definitions have been used in the last 20 years. Throughout these definitions a large number of individual terms are being used with very little agreement on their appropriate use. With rapidly expanding technology and increasing complexity within the terminology, future research is at risk of misrepresentation until the academic community agree on the most appropriate terminology to be used when defining VR.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2023.100741;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211883723000199;;;VR, ‘Definition’, ‘Term mapping’, ‘Content analysis’;;2211-8837;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Optimization of real-time traffic network assignment based on IoT data using DBN and clustering model in smart city;Jiachen Yang and Yurong Han and Yafang Wang and Bin Jiang and Zhihan Lv and Houbing Song;Future Generation Computer Systems;2020;Science@Direct;976-986;108;With the rapid development of the information age, smart city has gradually become the mainstream of urban construction. Dynamic transportation assignment has attracted more interest in the smart city construction under the new era of the Internet of things (IoT) because the urban road traffic is the heart of many problems in many fields, such as in the case of city congestion and processing center planning system. In this paper, we analyzed the processing center’s economic indexes and optimized the dynamic transportation network assignment based on continuous big IoT input database, and a high performance computing model is proposed for the dynamic traffic planning. Specifically, while the previous methods exploited the geographical information system (GIS) or K-means separately, the proposed transportation planning is based on the real-time IoT and GIS data, which is processed by DBN and K-means to make the final solution close to the practice and meet the requirements of high performance computing and economic cost. which is regarded as the key target index. Moreover, considering the large data characteristic of real-time online stream, the deep belief network (DBN) model is built to preprocess the data to improve the clustering effect of the K-means. This study works on the example case of hotel service centers problem in Tianjin to evaluate the optimal dynamic traffic network planning result. The experiment test has proved that based on the performance of super high computing, the model is precisely helpful for the optimal planning of traffic network under real time mass data situation and low cost, and promoting the construction and development of the smart city.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2017.12.012;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17310609;;;Smart city, Dynamic transportation assignment, IoT, Large data, Real-time online stream, DBN;;0167-739X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Proof of Evaluation-based energy and delay aware computation offloading for Digital Twin Edge Network;Elif Bozkaya and Müge Erel-Özçevik and Tuğçe Bilen and Yusuf Özçevik;Ad Hoc Networks;2023;Science@Direct;103254;149;The increasing availability of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has led to the development of new technologies. Specifically, the deployment of edge servers close to IoT devices has strengthened the edge computing paradigm. With the collaboration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and cloud computing, delay-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks can be offloaded to the edge/cloud servers to improve system performance in terms of the delay and energy consumption of IoT devices. However, there is a need to schedule the computation tasks for an efficient management. More importantly, the task scheduling strategy can face data tampering attacks to deliberately modify, destroy or manipulate the decisions. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we newly propose to integrate digital twin and blockchain into the edge networks. However, it is unclear (i) how energy and delay-aware computation should be combined, and (ii) which mining computations should be executed for a secure task scheduling. The state-of-the-art focuses on task scheduling and blockchain mining, separately. Therefore, we propose a novel blockchain-based digital twin-edge network architecture where our proposed algorithm solves these two challenges at the same execution. We design a three-layer system architecture, composed of physical entity layer, digital twin edge layer and blockchain layer. In the physical entity layer, we formulate an energy and delay-aware task scheduling problem. In the digital twin edge layer, we propose a novel Proof of Evaluation (PoE)-based secure energy and delay-aware task scheduling algorithm where optimization is executed by the genetic algorithm implementation of Warehouse Location Problem (WLP). In the blockchain layer, the best-found solutions are shared with the topology in a blockchain. Here, each block includes the hash of the previous block, a genetic algorithm-based solution, nonce value, and a hash of whole blocks in the blockchain. Thus, we aim to execute the computation tasks with an acceptable delay in an energy-efficient manner and prevent data tampering attacks against the optimal computation decisions. We validate the outcomes of our PoE-based secure digital twin-edge network model with extensive evaluations. Since the proposed model distributes the task not only to the local device but also to the MEC and cloud server for delay awareness, it reduces the delay but consumes more energy. Nevertheless, the additional energy consumption can be neglected against the delay reduction. The proposed scheme is also more scalable to compare with the conventional solution. The numerical results clearly show that the proposed model provides energy and delay awareness, maintaining both data integrity and trustworthiness at the same execution of algorithm.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103254;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870523001749;;;Digital twin, Mobile edge computing, Blockchain, Proof of evaluation, Task scheduling, Energy management;;1570-8705;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;DRM-SLAM: Towards dense reconstruction of monocular SLAM with scene depth fusion;Xinchen Ye and Xiang Ji and Baoli Sun and Shenglun Chen and Zhihui Wang and Haojie Li;Neurocomputing;2020;Science@Direct;76-91;396;Monocular visual SLAM methods can accurately track the camera pose and infer the scene structure by building sparse correspondence between two/multiple views of the scene. However, the reconstructed 3D maps of these methods are extremely sparse. On the other hand, deep learning is widely used to predict dense depth maps from single-view color images, but the results are subject to blurry depth boundaries, which severely deform the structure of 3D scene. Therefore, this paper proposes a dense reconstruction method under the monocular SLAM framework (DRM-SLAM), in which a novel scene depth fusion scheme is designed to fully utilize both the sparse depth samples from monocular SLAM and predicted dense depth maps from convolutional neural network (CNN). In the scheme, a CNN architecture is carefully designed for robust depth estimation. Besides, our approach also accounts for the problem of scale ambiguity existing in the monocular SLAM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and our captured dataset demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed DRM-SLAM. The evaluation of runtime and adaptability under challenging environments also verify the practicability of our method.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.02.044;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231220302344;;;Depth fusion, SLAM, Monocular, Depth estimation;;0925-2312;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

The use of both technologies in transportation systems has seen a tremendous growth that resulted in transformation of the transportation industry. Various modes of transportation, such as new transit systems, metro rails, high-speed rails, connected and automated vehicles, autonomous trains, and other emerging transportation modes (hyperloop, e-scooters, hoverboards), still face many challenges, including but not limited to economic issues, energy efficiency, social adoption, data privacy, lack of regulatory standards, reliability, security, and ethical issues. The use of blockchain and AI technologies has the potential to fill the technology gaps in transportation systems and effectively address the existing challenges. The convergence of both technologies is likely to yield significant advantages and provide a common distributed platform for data sharing, reliability, and decision-making.

Mobile edge computing extends mobile cloud computing close to end-users, decreasing latency and bandwidth utilisation by offloading tasks to edge servers.

;A robust brain pattern for brain-based authentication methods using deep breath;Fares Yousefi and Hoshang Kolivand;Computers & Security;2023;Science@Direct;103520;135;Security authentication involves the process of verifying a person's identity. Authentication technology has played a crucial role in data security for many years. However, existing typical biometric authentication technologies exhibit limitations related to usability, time efficiency, and notably, the long-term viability of the method. Recent technological advancements have led to the development of specific devices capable of reproducing human biometrics due to their visibility and tactile nature. Consequently, there is a demand for a new biometric method to address the limitations of current authentication systems. Human brain signals have been utilized in various Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Nevertheless, this approach also faces challenges related to usability, time efficiency, and most importantly, the stability of the method over time. Studies reveal that the stability of brain patterns poses a significant challenge in EEG-based authentication techniques. Stability refers to the capacity to withstand changes or disruptions, while permanency implies a lasting and unchanging state. Notably, stability can be temporary and subject to fluctuations, whereas permanency suggests a more enduring condition. Research demonstrates that utilizing alpha brainwaves is a superior option for authentication compared to other brainwave types. Many brain states lack stability in different situations. Interestingly, deep breathing can enhance alpha waves irrespective of the brain's current state. To explore the potential of utilizing deep breathing as a security pattern for authentication purposes, an experiment was conducted to investigate its effects on brain activity and its role in enhancing alpha brainwaves. By focusing on bolstering the permanency of brain patterns, our aim is to address the challenges associated with stability in EEG-based authentication techniques. The experimental results exhibited a high success rate of 91 % and 90 % for Support Vector Machine and Neural Network classifiers, respectively. These results suggest that deep breathing not only enhances permanency but could also serve as a suitable option for a brainwave-based authentication method.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103520;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823004303;;;BCI, Brain-based authentication, Brain-computer interface, Brain state stability, EEG signal;;0167-4048;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Although the devices have relatively low memory, resource, and processing capability, the trend is that nodes generate a large volume of data. That is where cloud technology comes into play to provide storage space. Because of its centralized nature and robustness, a large network operating with cloud assistance may be vulnerable. Due to rigid access control policies, the devices may be vulnerable to malicious activity. On the other hand, cloud technology provides a platform for such a security system to operate. A centralized secure architecture fails to consider mobile and edge devices within the context of these criteria. This raises numerous concerns about trusting third-party cloud intermediaries, which cause security and privacy leaks. The goal of this research is to look into the problem of blockchain consensus algorithms and their applicability in IoT with cloud-native infrastructure in the Ethereum and MultiChain variants. The significant challenge is scaling the core layer without sacrificing decentralization, security, or public verifiability. This type of testbed is used to investigate the impact of architectural design and consensus models in a lightweight IoT environment. Consensus in each IoT transaction remains the most important aspect of blockchain-enabled IoT networks. When the ledger is updated without privacy protection, transaction-oriented breaches can occur. Current practices for integrating finite IoT network resources into infrastructure-oriented blockchain implementations are flawed due to they are willing to sacrifice data security and integrity in order to save time and energy. This encourages researchers to investigate an improved lightweight block verification approach to the blockchain functional framework, that decreases processing needs, network latency, and network overhead substantially.

;Maturity level assessments of information security controls: An empirical analysis of practitioners assessment capabilities;Christopher Schmitz and Michael Schmid and David Harborth and Sebastian Pape;Computers & Security;2021;Science@Direct;102306;108;Maturity models are a widely used concept for measuring information security. The idea is to systematically evaluate the maturity of security-relevant processes in an organisation. This enables decision-makers to get an overview of the implementation status of relevant processes to identify neuralgic points. Maturity models thus play a central role in the conception of information security management systems (ISMS). Some industries, for instance, the German automotive industry, have even established security maturity levels as the de facto standard for measuring information security. However, the quality of security maturity level assessments has not been sufficiently investigated yet. Therefore, we have analysed to what extent security managers can accurately assess the maturity levels of security controls. To verify the quality of maturity level assessments a case study was conducted where security experts assessed a subset of the ISO/IEC 27002 security controls for a hypothetical scenario using the COBIT maturity levels. Additionally, ex-post interviews have been conducted with several participants of the study to verify some of the hypotheses developed during the previous analyses. Our results show that many security experts struggled with the task and did not perform well. However, we discovered professional characteristics that have a strong significant effect on the assessment capabilities. We also identified various types of additional support that can help practitioners to make more reliable assessments in practice. Moreover, the experts' self-perception was overly optimistic when asked to assess their performance. We even found a weak inverted correlation for more experienced experts, also known as Dunning-Kruger effect. Our results have a strong impact on practice since they indicate that practitioners need support to carry out high-quality assessments and they also show what kind of support addresses the identified challenges.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102306;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404821001309;;;Usability evaluation, Security controls, Maturity levels, ISO 27002, COBIT;;0167-4048;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is close to data source and users, so terminals can execute tasks at the edge of network. In this way, the heavy load on core network can be relieved and tasks can be executed effectively. However, the demands of users vary from each other and users move all the time. It is difficult for the existing way of service supply to meet demands of all users. Cognitive Agent (CA) is put forward in this paper to help users cache and execute tasks on MEC in advance. In detail, CA is used to build personalized model combined with users’ behavior data. At the same time, it uses Long short-term memory neural network to forecast the moving trajectory of terminal equipment and the service types to be requested, uses the prediction result to generate caching strategy, cache business and shorten the delay of task execution. Besides, to further reduce the stress on MEC, we propose the collaboration of computing, communicating and caching resource with neighboring users’ equipment. To verify the effectiveness of CA, we build a model that assesses the performance of the system. Finally, we design a simulation experiment to execute resource request and resource collaboration. The result of the experiments show that CA can improve the efficiency of communication network, relieve the stress on network and improve the quality of services to users.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.08.001;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19318783;;;Cognitive agent, Mobile edge computing, Caching strategy, Resource collaboration;;0167-739X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Towards practical 3D ultrasound sensing on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices;Shuangjiao Zhai and Guixin Ye and Zhanyong Tang and Jie Ren and Dingyi Fang and Baoying Liu and Zheng Wang;Computer Networks;2021;Science@Direct;107990;191;Ultrasound based contactless sensing has the potential to extend the interactive range of mobile devices significantly. However, existing approaches either require multiple transceiver pairs that are not available on commercial mobile devices or can only recognize simple actions with one single stroke. These drawbacks significantly limit the practicability of prior work. This article presents UltraScr, an ultrasound sensing system that can recognize the sophisticated gestures with multiple strokes (e.g., writing a capital letter) using just a single sound transceiver pair. To do so, UltraScr first uses the frequency attenuation profile (FAP) to capture the subtle hand movements. It then employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the subtle hand movements’ discriminative features to build an accurate ultrasound sensing system. We go further by exploiting the rejection classification method (RCM) and incremental learning to improve the robustness of our sensing system in the end-user environment. We evaluate UltraScr by applying it to gesture recognition across different scenarios and users. Extensive experimental results show that while using only one transceiver pair, the performance of UltraScr is comparable to the multi-transceiver-paired implementations. We show that UltraScr is robust to the change of external conditions (i.e., different humidity and battery) and can work effectively on a wide range of locations, but requires 3× fewer training samples compared to the state-of-the-art.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.107990;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128621001134;;;Wireless sensing, Frequency attenuation profile, Ultrasound sensing, Machine learning;;1389-1286;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Shamim Hossain;Ad Hoc Networks;2023;Science@Direct;103263;150;The metaverse, as an impressive technology, can achieve outstanding performance in many fields. With the development of deep neural networks (DNNs), more and more metaverse artificial intelligence (AI) applications are emerging, which have low tolerance for delay. The edge computing based metaverse AI can overcome this problem. However, these AI applications bring new challenges of high reliability, especially DNNs are subject to the security risk of adversarial attacks that generate small and imperceptible noise and cause classifier to make predictions with a high error probability. To meet the reliability requirements of AI applications, in this paper, we propose a security mechanism against adversarial attacks in edge computing based metaverse AI applications. This mechanism utilizes a modified ResNet model that defends against adversarial attacks. We deploy it on the edge cloud to preprocess the data uploaded by metaverse AI applications. In order to achieve a better model performance, we use multiple residual network blocks to build this neural network model on the basis of autoencoder. To assist the model to produce defensively high-quality images, we utilize several convolution layers with various step sizes to process multi-scale images and design to use multiple types of samples with different properties together for the model training. We evaluate our method with experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, and against five attacks such as FGSM and DeepFool attacks.

;Binary thresholding defense against adversarial attacks;Yutong Wang and Wenwen Zhang and Tianyu Shen and Hui Yu and Fei-Yue Wang;Neurocomputing;2021;Science@Direct;61-71;445;Convolutional neural networks are always vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In recent research, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) has been recognized as the most effective attack method, and adversarial training on adversarial examples generated by PGD attack is the most reliable defense method. However, adversarial training requires a large amount of computation time. In this paper, we propose a fast, simple and strong defense method that achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off. We first compare the feature maps of naturally trained model with adversarially trained model in same architecture, then we find the key of adversarially trained model lies on the binary thresholding the convolutional layers perform. Inspired by this, we perform binary thresholding to preprocess the input image and defend against PGD attack. On MNIST, our defense achieves 99.0% accuracy on clean images and 91.2% on white-box adversarial images. This performance is slightly better than adversarial training, and our method largely saves the computation time for retraining. On Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, we train a new model on binarized images and use this model to defend against attack. Though its performance is not as good as adversarial training, it gains the best speed-accuracy trade-off.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.03.036;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221004045;;;Binary thresholding, Defense, Adversarial training, Adversarial attack;;0925-2312;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Shamim Hossain and Ghulam Muhammad;Computer Communications;2020;Science@Direct;93-103;155;With the rapid growth of mobile devices and the emergence of 5G applications, the burden of cellular and the use of the licensed band have enormous challenges. In order to solve this problem, opportunity communication is regarded as a potential solution. It can use unlicensed bands to forward content to users under delay-tolerance constraints, as well as reduce cellular data traffic. Since opportunity communication is easily interrupted when User Equipment (UE) is moving, we adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict the location of the mobile UE. Then, the meta-heuristic algorithm is used to allocate multiple contents. In addition, deep learning-based methods almost need a lot of training time. Based on real-time requirements of the network, we propose AI-enabled opportunistic networks architecture, combined with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to implement edge AI applications. The simulation results show that the proposed multiple contents offloading mechanism can reduce cellular data traffic through UE location prediction and cache allocation.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2020.02.084;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366419314239;;;Opportunistic networks, MEC, Offloading, Content caching;;0140-3664;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

To save run time and maintain high accuracy, we present a new light-weight model in this paper, i.e., a Residual-based Dynamic Receptive Field Network (RDRF-Net). This model can automatically select the receptive fields suitable for different image scales to generate the depth maps with higher fitting degrees. Residual design and bottleneck layers are used to compress the network for reducing run time. Three groups of experiments are performed on the KITTI dataset to test the accuracy, computation time, and the impact of dynamic receptive fields.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) could extract knowledge from this audiovisual data but they typically require large amounts of resources (processing power, memory and energy). If all limitations of the execution environment are known beforehand, we can design neural networks under these constraints. An IoT setting however is a very heterogeneous environment where the constraints can change rapidly. We propose a technique allowing us to deploy a variety of different networks at runtime, each with a specific complexity-accuracy trade-off but without having to store each network independently. We train a sequence of networks of increasing size and constrain each network to contain the parameters of all smaller networks in the sequence. We only need to store the largest network to be able to deploy each of the smaller networks. We experimentally validate our approach on different benchmark datasets for image recognition and conclude that we can build networks that support multiple trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.03.001;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17324664;;;IoT, Deep neural networks, Resource efficient inference;;0167-739X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Edge intelligence in motion: Mobility-aware dynamic DNN inference service migration with downtime in mobile edge computing;Pu Wang and Tao Ouyang and Guocheng Liao and Jie Gong and Shuai Yu and Xu Chen;Journal of Systems Architecture;2022;Science@Direct;102664;130;Edge intelligence (EI) becomes a trend to push the deep learning frontiers to the network edge, so that deep neural networks (DNNs) applications can be well leveraged at resource-constrained mobile devices with benefits of edge computing. Due to the high user mobility among scattered edge servers in many scenarios such as internet of vehicular applications, dynamic service migration is desired to maintain a reliable and efficient quality of service (QoS). However, inevitable service downtime incurred by service migration would largely degrade the real-time performance of delay-sensitive DNN inference services. To address this issue, we advocate a user-centric management for dynamic DNN inference service migration with flexible multi-exit mechanism, aiming at maximizing overall user utility (e.g., DNN model inference accuracy) with various service downtime. We first leverage dynamic programming to propose an optimal offline migration and exit point selection strategy (OMEPS) algorithm when complete future information of user behaviors is available. Amenable to a more practical application domain without complete future information, we incorporate the OMEPS algorithm into a model predictive control (MPC) framework, then construct a mobility-aware service migration and DNN exit point selection (MOMEPS) algorithm, which improves the long-term user utility within limited predictive future information. However, heavy computation overheads of MOMEPS algorithm impose burdens on mobile devices, thus we further advocate a cost-efficient algorithm, named smart-MOMEPS, which introduces a smart migration judgement based on Neural Networks to control the implementation of (MOMEPS) algorithm by wisely estimating whether the DNN service should be migrated or not. Extensive trace-driven simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our smart-MOMEPS algorithm for achieving significant overall utility improvements with low computation overheads compared with other online algorithms.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2022.102664;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762122001771;;;DNN service migration, Multi-exit DNN, Service downtime, Mobile edge computing, Model predictive control;;1383-7621;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Dependent tasks offloading in mobile edge computing: A multi-objective evolutionary optimization strategy;Yanqi Gong and Kun Bian and Fei Hao and Yifei Sun and Yulei Wu;Future Generation Computer Systems;2023;Science@Direct;314-325;148;Due to the proliferation of applications such as virtual reality and online games with high real-time requirements, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has become a promising computing paradigm that can improve user experience and reduce the task offloading latency. The cloud–edge-end collaborative offloading further addresses the problem of insufficient computing resources of edge servers owing to large-scale computing-intensive applications in MEC. However, existing offloading solutions often ignore the important factor of economic cost, making it hard for these solutions to achieve a sustainable cloud–edge-end collaborative computation. To this end, this paper considers a multi-user multi-server, cloud–edge-end collaborative offloading scenario in the presence of dependent offloading tasks for the sake of maximizing rewards and minimizing latency. Each user issues a computing-intensive application consisting of multiple dependent tasks, which are offloaded collaboratively by various computational resources. With the goal of maximizing the yield of offloading for users and server providers, a multi-objective optimization problem of joint task offloading and execution rewards is studied. Technically, a multivariate multi-objective optimization problem with three objectives is modeled. An efficient multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm based on MOEA/D is then developed to solve the latency minimization and reward maximization problems. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and illustrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve user offloading benefits. In addition, a scalability evaluations of our proposed algorithm is conducted for demonstrating its feasibility in large-scale task offloading scenarios.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2023.06.015;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X23002364;;;Dependent task offloading, Mobile edge computing, Multi-objective optimization, Evolutionary computation, Cloud–edge-end collaborative computing;;0167-739X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;NRPose: Towards noise resistance for multi-person pose estimation;Jianhang He and Junyao Sun and Qiong Liu and Shaowu Peng;Pattern Recognition;2023;Science@Direct;109680;142;The high signal-to-noise ratio is one of the main challenges of multi-person pose estimation (MPE) and receives little attention. In this work, we find that MPE suffers from two types of noise: aleatoric noise and epistemic noise. The former represents the noise inherent in the observations, such as the background. The latter indicates the noise brought by the priori hypotheses, such as the inappropriate keypoint relations. Both of them reduce the saliency of information available for keypoint localization. We propose the noise-resistance pose estimation (NRPose) that integrates keypoint-oriented region proposal module (KRPM) and pose-aware sparse relation module (PSRM). To mitigate aleatoric noise, KRPM generates keypoint-level RoIs by circumscribing semantically significant regions.

;A systematic review of global research on natural user interface for smart home system;Longhui Liao and Yifei Liang and Hong Li and Yuehua Ye and Guangdong Wu;International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics;2023;Science@Direct;103445;95;The smart home system (SHS) equipped with intelligent sensors and actuators aims at providing seamless services for users. The natural user interface (NUI) enables intuitive interaction between users and the SHS, significantly lowering the barrier to entry and enhancing user experience. However, a comprehensive evaluation of research on NUI for the SHS to provide a valuable synthesis of existing research and informing future research directions remains unavailable. This study attempts to address this gap by systematically evaluating 1979 relevant journal and conference articles from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus, and those articles with a weak connection to the topic and poor data integrity were excluded. Finally, 1330 articles were chosen to for analysis in terms of contributions, critical papers, co-occurrence, and clustering using scientometric techniques. It was revealed that, with the help of advancing technologies, the research field of NUI aims to enrich the variety of interactive device types, improve the accuracy of interpreting and responding to user behavior, and optimize the compatibility with diverse user demographics. Besides, a conceptual framework summarizing typical types of NUI for the SHS was proposed, and strengths and weaknesses of each NUI were discussed for investigating specific future directions. Furthermore, four general research directions (strategies for promoting effective multimodal NUI, adoption of artificial intelligence for better performance, exploration of mixed reality applications in the SHS, and standardization of protocols in the smart home ecosystem) were also identified for academics and practitioners in their future research and practice.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2023.103445;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169814123000379;;;Smart home system, Human-machine interface, Natural user interface, Scientometric analysis;;0169-8141;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Decision-support framework to evaluate the practicality of 5G for intralogistics use cases in standalone non-public networks;Thorge Lackner and Johannes L. Jooste and Daniel Palm;Procedia CIRP;2023;Science@Direct;51-56;120;In the context of Industry 4.0, intralogistics faces an increasingly complex and dynamic environment driven by a high level of product customisation and complex manufacturing processes. One approach to deal with these changing conditions is the decentralised and intelligent connectivity of intralogistics systems. However, wireless connectivity presents a major challenge in the industry due to strict requirements such as safety and real-time data transmission. In this context, the fifth generation of mobile communications (5G) is a promising technology to meet the requirements of safety-critical applications. Particularly, since 5G offers the possibility of establishing private 5G networks, also referred to as standalone non-public networks. Through their isolation from public networks, private 5G networks provide exclusive coverage for private organisations offering them high intrinsic network control and data security. However, 5G is still under development and is being gradually introduced in a continuous release process. This process lacks transparency regarding the performance of 5G in individual releases, complicating the successful adoption of 5G as an industrial communication. Additionally, the evaluation of 5G against the specified target performance is insufficient due to the impact of the environment and external interfering factors on 5G in the industrial environment. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a technical decision-support framework that takes a holistic approach to evaluate the practicality of 5G for intralogistics use cases by considering two fundamental stages. The first of these analyses technical parameters and characteristics of the use case to evaluate the theoretical feasibility of 5G. The second stage investigates the application's environment, which substantially impacts the practicality of 5G, for instance, the influence of surrounding materials. Finally, a case study validates the proposed framework by means of an autonomous mobile robot. As a result, the validation proves the proposed framework's applicability and shows the practicality of the autonomous mobile robot, when integrating it into a private 5G network testbed.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.08.010;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827123006819;;;Decision-support framework, 5G, intralogistics, use cases, non-public networks, private 5G networks, practicality;;2212-8271;;56th CIRP International Conference on Manufacturing Systems 2023;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;YOLOPose V2: Understanding and improving transformer-based 6D pose estimation;Arul Selvam Periyasamy and Arash Amini and Vladimir Tsaturyan and Sven Behnke;Robotics and Autonomous Systems;2023;Science@Direct;104490;168;6D object pose estimation is a crucial prerequisite for autonomous robot manipulation applications. The state-of-the-art models for pose estimation are convolutional neural network (CNN)-based. Lately, Transformers, an architecture originally proposed for natural language processing, is achieving state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks as well. Equipped with the multi-head self-attention mechanism, Transformers enable simple single-stage end-to-end architectures for learning object detection and 6D object pose estimation jointly. In this work, we propose YOLOPose (short form for You Only Look Once Pose estimation), a Transformer-based multi-object 6D pose estimation method based on keypoint regression and an improved variant of the YOLOPose model. In contrast to the standard heatmaps for predicting keypoints in an image, we directly regress the keypoints. Additionally, we employ a learnable orientation estimation module to predict the orientation from the keypoints. Along with a separate translation estimation module, our model is end-to-end differentiable. Our method is suitable for real-time applications and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We analyze the role of object queries in our architecture and reveal that the object queries specialize in detecting objects in specific image regions. Furthermore, we quantify the accuracy trade-off of using datasets of smaller sizes to train our model.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2023.104490;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092188902300129X;;;Vision transformers, Object pose estimation, Object detection;;0921-8890;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Unlike outdoor environments, indoor environments have additional challenges, such as weak signals, low light, and complex scenarios. Different technologies are used for indoor navigation, including WiFi, Bluetooth, inertial sensors, and computer cameras. Vision-based methods have great potentials for indoor navigation as they fulfill most of the general requirements such as minimal cost, ease of use, ease of implementation, and realism. Therefore, researchers have successively proposed different novel vision-based approaches for indoor navigation. Unfortunately, there is no standard review article (except a few general reviews) that covers the current trends and draws a pipeline for future research. In this paper, we reviewed the current state-of-the-art vision-based indoor navigation methods. We followed the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology for article searching, selection, and quality assessments. In total, we selected 68 articles after final selection using SLR. We classified these articles into different categories. Each article is briefly studied for information extraction, including key idea, category of the article, evaluation criterion, and its strengths and weaknesses. We also highlighted several interesting future directions. This study will help new researchers to grasp the research challenge as well as present the results of their research in the field.

;Healthcare analytics: A techno-functional perspective;Sumanta Singha and Himanshu Arha and Arpan Kumar Kar;Technological Forecasting and Social Change;2023;Science@Direct;122908;197;The use of data analytics, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), has significantly transformed decision-making in healthcare. However, academic scholarship has expressed concerns over the misalignment of research priorities and their impact on data usage and choice of analytics. On the one hand, an inadequate understanding of healthcare themes and algorithmic nuances has posed difficulty for healthcare professionals to evaluate AI solutions and understand their generalizability and potential biases. On the other hand, the abundance of analytical tools, their complexity, and a misalignment between data type and analysis methods have presented major challenges for analysts in selecting a suitable method. As a result, healthcare research has mostly developed in silos. We propose a techno-functional framework that combines the perspectives of analysts and healthcare professionals, identifies key research themes (i.e., healthcare delivery, patient engagement, data management, market design, and policy and governance), and presents critical research questions that can guide future studies. We also propose a schema for segmenting analysis techniques based on data type and analytical complexity. This schema may help analysts select a suitable analysis technique and data to solve a specific problem.

;The HORSE framework: A reference architecture for cyber-physical systems in hybrid smart manufacturing;Konstantinos Traganos and Paul Grefen and Irene Vanderfeesten and Jonnro Erasmus and Georgios Boultadakis and Panagiotis Bouklis;Journal of Manufacturing Systems;2021;Science@Direct;461-494;61;In the Industry 4.0 era, manufacturers strive to remain competitive by using advanced technologies such as collaborative robots, automated guided vehicles, augmented reality support and smart devices. However, only if these technological advancements are integrated into their system context in a seamless way, they can deliver their full potential to a manufacturing organization. This integration requires a system architecture as a blueprint for positioning and interconnection of the technologies. For this purpose, the HORSE framework, resulting from the HORSE EU H2020 project, has been developed to act as a reference architecture of a cyber-physical system to integrate various Industry 4.0 technologies and support hybrid manufacturing processes, i.e., processes in which human and robotic workers collaborate. The architecture has been created using design science research, based on well-known software engineering frameworks, established manufacturing domain standards and practical industry requirements. The value of a reference architecture is mainly established by application in practice. For this purpose, this paper presents the application and evaluation of the HORSE framework in 10 manufacturing plants across Europe, each with its own characteristics. Through the physical deployment and demonstration, the framework proved its goal to be basis for the well-structured design of an operational smart manufacturing cyber-physical system that provides horizontal, cross-functional management of manufacturing processes and vertical control of heterogeneous technologies in work cells. We report on valuable insights on the difficulties to realize such systems in specific situations. The experiences form the basis for improved adoption, further improvement and extension of the framework. In sum, this paper shows how a reference architecture framework supports the structured application of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing environments that so far have relied on more traditional digital technology.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.09.003;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612521001898;;;Smart manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Cyber-physical systems, Reference architecture, HORSE EU project;;0278-6125;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;On the feasibility of Federated Learning towards on-demand client deployment at the edge;Mario Chahoud and Safa Otoum and Azzam Mourad;Information Processing & Management;2023;Science@Direct;103150;60;Nowadays, researchers are investing their time and devoting their efforts in developing and motivating the 6G vision and resources that are not available in 5G. Edge computing and autonomous vehicular driving applications are more enhanced under the 6G services that are provided to successfully operate tasks. The huge volume of data resulting from such applications can be a plus in the AI and Machine Learning (ML) world. Traditional ML models are used to train their models on centralized data sets. Lately, data privacy becomes a real aspect to take into consideration while collecting data. For that, Federated Learning (FL) plays nowadays a great role in addressing privacy and technology together by maintaining the ability to learn over decentralized data sets. The training is limited to the user devices only while sharing the locally computed parameter with the server that aggregates those updated weights to optimize a global model. This scenario is repeated multiple rounds for better results and convergence. Most of the literature proposed client selection methods to converge faster and increase accuracy. However, none of them has targeted the ability to deploy and select clients in real-time wherever and whenever needed. In fact, some mobile and vehicular devices are not available to serve as clients in the FL due to the highly dynamic environments and/or do not have the capabilities to accomplish this task. In this paper, we address the aforementioned limitations by introducing an on-demand client deployment in FL offering more volume and heterogeneity of data in the learning process. We make use of containerization technology such as Docker to build efficient environments using any type of client devices serving as volunteering devices, and Kubernetes utility called Kubeadm to monitor the devices. The performed experiments illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach and the efficiency of the deployment of clients whenever and wherever needed.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103150;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457322002515;;;Edge computing, 6G, Artificial Intelligence, Federated Learning, Privacy, On-demand client deployment;;0306-4573;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

However, an accurate prediction would assist educators and learning experts in the extraction of useful knowledge for designing learning interventions for improving teams’ outcomes. The main objective of the current paper is to explore and propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework for binary classification with two hidden layers, for the early prediction of teams’ performance in the domain of software engineering. The framework was evaluated by using different activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLu, and Tanh) and optimizers (Adagrad and Adadelta).

Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was used to interpret the framework and extract the most important features having a positive or negative impact on its final prediction. Among other conclusions, it was shown that the prediction accuracy of the framework, when the Adadelta and Adagrad optimizers were used, was found to be 76.73% and 82.39%, respectively, while its overall learning performance was 80.76% and 86.57%, meaning that it is capable of predicting teams’ performance adequately and accurately.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107355;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494621002787;;;Deep neural network, Team performance prediction, Collaboration, Machine learning, Computer-assisted learning;;1568-4946;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

This study presents such an approach, and aims to introduce undergraduate students to fundamental PDC concepts without the expectation that they can apply those concepts. The proposed approach is inspired by the success seen in the wider computing education literature, where analogies and visualization have helped students understand other abstract computing topics. The proposed learning resources come in the form of a series of short videos, carefully aligned to a learning activity that guides towards achieving the intended learning outcomes. In addition to being a simple activity to complete with students, evaluations illustrate its value even with minimal guidance from the instructor.

;Augmented Reality Visualization for Image-Guided Surgery: A Validation Study Using a Three-Dimensional Printed Phantom;H.H. Glas and J. Kraeima and P.M.A. {van Ooijen} and F.K.L. Spijkervet and L. Yu and M.J.H. Witjes;Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery;2021;Science@Direct;1943.e1-1943.e10;79;"Background
Oral and maxillofacial surgery currently relies on virtual surgery planning based on image data (CT, MRI). Three-dimensional (3D) visualizations are typically used to plan and predict the outcome of complex surgical procedures. To translate the virtual surgical plan to the operating room, it is either converted into physical 3D-printed guides or directly translated using real-time navigation systems.
Purpose
This study aims to improve the translation of the virtual surgery plan to a surgical procedure, such as oncologic or trauma surgery, in terms of accuracy and speed. Here we report an augmented reality visualization technique for image-guided surgery. It describes how surgeons can visualize and interact with the virtual surgery plan and navigation data while in the operating room. The user friendliness and usability is objectified by a formal user study that compared our augmented reality assisted technique to the gold standard setup of a perioperative navigation system (Brainlab). Moreover, accuracy of typical navigation tasks as reaching landmarks and following trajectories is compared.
Results
Overall completion time of navigation tasks was 1.71 times faster using augmented reality (P = .034). Accuracy improved significantly using augmented reality (P < .001), for reaching physical landmarks a less strong correlation was found (P = .087). Although the participants were relatively unfamiliar with VR/AR (rated 2.25/5) and gesture-based interaction (rated 2/5), they reported that navigation tasks become easier to perform using augmented reality (difficulty Brainlab rated 3.25/5, HoloLens 2.4/5).
Conclusion
The proposed workflow can be used in a wide range of image-guided surgery procedures as an addition to existing verified image guidance systems. Results of this user study imply that our technique enables typical navigation tasks to be performed faster and more accurately compared to the current gold standard. In addition, qualitative feedback on our augmented reality assisted technique was more positive compared to the standard setup.?>";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2021.04.001;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278239121003220;;;;;0278-2391;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

This study collected literature on augmented reality (AR) from academic and patent databases to plot the historic development trajectory of AR and forecast its future research and development trends. A total of 3193 and 13,629 papers were collected from academic and patent databases, respectively. First, a network was established using references from the academic literature; main path analysis was conducted on this reference network to plot the overall development trajectory. Subsequent cluster and word cloud analyses revealed the following five major groups of AR research topics: AR surgical navigation applications, AR education applications, AR applications in manufacturing, AR applications in architecture, and AR applications in visual tracking. Subsequently, the relationships between the overall development trajectory and the five AR research topics were compared. Next, the title and abstract of AR-related academic and patent papers were subjected to text mining to identify keywords with a high frequency of occurrence. The results can provide a reference for industry, government, and academia when planning future development strategies for the AR field.

;Are you talking to me? An Audio Augmented Reality conversational guide for cultural heritage;Michalis Tsepapadakis and Damianos Gavalas;Pervasive and Mobile Computing;2023;Science@Direct;101797;92;Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are increasingly utilized as a means of stimulating immersive experiences to cultural site visitors, mainly through visual superimposition of interactive digital elements onto the physical world. Recent research has investigated the use of Audio AR (AAR) in heritage sites, wherein visitors listen to spatially registered sound which could be attributed to ‘talking’ physical artefacts. A parallel trend in the audience engagement programs of cultural institutions involves the employment of AI chatbots which are engaged in dialogues with followers or visitors to provide meaningful responses to a number of user questions. Herein, we present Exhibot, an intelligent audio guide system aiming at enhancing the user experience of cultural site visitors. Exhibot involves the combination of AAR and chatbot technologies to enable natural visitor-exhibit interaction, while also leveraging IoT devices to contextualize the delivered information. The key contribution of the proposed system lies in the interplay of AAR, chatbot and IoT technologies to create immersive learning experiences in the context of an integrated cultural guide system. Exhibot has undergone field trials to validate its usability and utility in realistic operational conditions. As a case study, we have chosen the statue of a prominent politician situated at a central square in Heraklion, Greece. The evaluation results indicated a very positive attitude of users, which is attributed both to the sense of immersion evoked by the AAR-powered storytelling and the natural human-like conversation enabled by the chatbot.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmcj.2023.101797;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157411922300055X;;;Audio Augmented Reality, Conversational audio guide, AI chatbot, Cultural heritage, Cultural user experience, IoT, Context-awareness, Spatial sound, User evaluation, IBM watson, Exhibot;;1574-1192;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

We cover a broad spectrum from acquainting learners with VR and AR as only one aspect of a more general course to an in-depth course on VR and AR during a whole semester. The focus of the paper is methods and techniques that allow learners to not only learn about VR and AR on a theoretical level but that facilitate their own VR and AR experiences with all senses and foster hands-on learning. We show why this is challenging (e.g., the high workload involved with the preparation of hands-on experiences, the large amount of course time that needs to be devoted), and how these challenges can be met (e.g., using our Circuit Parcours Technique). Moreover, we discuss learning goals that can be addressed in VR and AR courses besides hands-on experiences when using our methods and techniques.

;Privacy computing meets metaverse: Necessity, taxonomy and challenges;Chuan Chen and Yuecheng Li and Zhenpeng Wu and Chengyuan Mai and Youming Liu and Yanming Hu and Zibin Zheng and Jiawen Kang;Ad Hoc Networks;2024;Science@Direct;103457;;Metaverse, the core of the next-generation Internet, is a computer-generated holographic digital environment that simultaneously combines spatio-temporal, immersive, real-time, sustainable, interoperable, and data-sensitive characteristics. It cleverly blends the virtual and real worlds, allowing users to create, communicate, and transact in virtual form. With the rapid development of emerging technologies including augmented reality, virtual reality and blockchain, the metaverse system is becoming more and more sophisticated and widely used in various fields such as social, tourism, industry and economy. However, the high level of interaction with the real world also means a huge risk of privacy leakage both for individuals and enterprises, which has hindered the wide deployment of metaverse. Then, it is inevitable to apply privacy computing techniques in the framework of metaverse, which is a current research hotspot. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive research on the necessity, taxonomy and challenges when privacy computing meets metaverse.

With the gradual intellectualization of modern life, more and more applications need to infer relevant semantic information from images for subsequent processing, such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, video surveillance, etc. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technologies of semantic segmentation based on deep learning. Because semantic segmentation requires a large number of pixel-level annotations, in order to reduce the fine-grained requirements of annotation and reduce the economic and time cost of manual annotation, this paper studies the works on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. In order to enhance the generalization ability and robustness of the segmentation model, this paper investigates the works on domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. Many types of sensors are usually equipped in some practical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. In order to mine the association between multi-modal data and improve the accuracy of the segmentation model, this paper investigates the works based on multi-modal data fusion semantic segmentation. The real-time performance of the model needs to be considered in practical application.

The current self-supervised video object segmentation approaches are implemented by modeling the pairwise correspondence between the target and reference frames. The pairwise correspondence only maintains spatio-temporal consistency. However, the VOS tasks not only require a spatio-temporal relationship between the two frames but also require the salient object information for each frame. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a disentangled representation strategy to disentangle the temporal correspondence into the pairwise term and unary term. The pairwise and unary terms capture inter-frame spatio-temporal and intra-frame salient object information, respectively. To demonstrate the importance of the disentangled representation, we apply the proposed approach to DAVIS-2017 and YouTube-VOS datasets.

;Load-aware dynamic controller placement based on deep reinforcement learning in SDN-enabled mobile cloud-edge computing networks;Chenglin Xu and Cheng Xu and Bo Li and Siqi Li and Tao Li;Computer Networks;2023;Science@Direct;109900;234;Software-defined networks (SDNs) can improve network resource utilization and optimize the performance of mobile cloud-edge computing networks (MECCNs) through unified and flexible network management. However, network traffic in MECCNs can change over time and space, which affects the performance of the control plane in an SDN. Further, an MECCN may require the temporary addition of network access points, further reducing the network management capabilities of the control plane. To ensure that the control plane can handle the constant changes in network traffic, adapt to dynamic changes in network access points, and provide continuous and efficient network management functions, this study focuses on the dynamic controller placement problem in SDN-enabled MECCNs. We study the deployment of a two-layer control plane and accordingly construct the corresponding delay, load balancing, and control reliability models. Next, we construct a joint optimization problem considering the developed delay, load balancing, and control reliability, and solve this problem using an algorithm based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm.

Due to the varying 5G network conditions and limited computation capacity of each base station in the multi-cell MEC, as well as the stringent QoS requirements, a fundamental and challenging problem is how to offload user tasks to the edge cloud, such that the energy consumption of mobile devices is minimized. In this paper, we first formulate the offline and online location-aware mobile task offloading problems in a multi-cell MEC. For the offline location-aware mobile task offloading problem, we then develop an exact solution and an approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio. For the online problem, we thirdly propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based offloading algorithm for mobile users to obtain the optimal offloading policy. We finally conduct extensive experiments by simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithms against existing benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are promising and outperform the benchmark algorithms by significantly reducing energy cost of mobile devices and delays experienced by mobile users.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107276;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128620301699;;;Task offloading, Mobile edge computing, Approximation algorithm;;1389-1286;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Learning robots to grasp by demonstration;Elias {De Coninck} and Tim Verbelen and Pieter {Van Molle} and Pieter Simoens and Bart Dhoedt;Robotics and Autonomous Systems;2020;Science@Direct;103474;127;In recent years, we have witnessed the proliferation of so-called collaborative robots or cobots, that are designed to work safely along with human operators. These cobots typically use the “program from demonstration” paradigm to record and replay trajectories, rather than the traditional source-code based programming approach. While this requires less knowledge from the operator, the basic functionality of a cobot is limited to simply replay the sequence of actions as they were recorded. In this paper, we present a system that mitigates this restriction and learns to grasp an arbitrary object from visual input using demonstrated examples. While other learning-based approaches for robotic grasping require collecting a large amount of examples, either manually or automatically harvested in a real or simulated world, our approach learns to grasp from a single demonstration with the ability to improve on accuracy using additional input samples. We demonstrate grasping of various objects with the Franka Panda collaborative robot. We show that the system is able to grasp various objects from demonstration, regardless their position and rotation in less than 5 min of training time on a NVIDIA Titan X GPU, achieving over 90% average success rate.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2020.103474;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889019304956;;;Artificial neural networks, Machine learning, Collaborative robotics, Industrial internet of things;;0921-8890;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

The use of simulations and digital technologies in education in the health field is common. Virtual reality technologies, which offer three-dimensional (immersive) simulation environments, have become easily accessible and cost-effective in recent years and this has this has increased this use of this technology in educating students who will work in the health field.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to investigate the views of midwifery undergraduate students about the current episiotomy education they received and their expectations when related education is given with virtual reality technology.
Participants
Students in their third or fourth year of undergraduate midwifery who have taken prior episiotomy education.
Design

Methods
Participants were asked open-ended questions to collect qualitative data. Data were analysed using content analysis by MaxQDA.
Results
Data were analysed, and four main themes were determined. These main themes consisted of 16 sub-themes, and included midwifery department students' positive and negative opinions about the current episiotomy education and their expectations in cases where the education is carried out using virtual education environments.
Conclusions
Although the current episiotomy education has positive aspects, such as suturing ability, it does not give a sense of reality, is not repetitive, and has many negative aspects, such as cost.

;An integrated VR/AR framework for user-centric interactive experience of cultural heritage: The ArkaeVision project;Guido Bozzelli and Antonio Raia and Stefano Ricciardi and Maurizio {De Nino} and Nicola Barile and Marco Perrella and Marco Tramontano and Alfonsina Pagano and Augusto Palombini;Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage;2019;Science@Direct;e00124;15;The ArkaeVision project is aimed at enabling a new way of enjoying Cultural Heritage through a more engaging and culturally-qualified user experience. The main goal is the creation of a technological infrastructure for the permanent enhancement of cultural resources. Hence, ArkaeVision represents a user-centric integrated system able to offer different modalities of exploitation of Cultural Heritage assets, including virtual representations of monuments, works of art and objects, as well as the stories associated to them. ArkaeVision therefore introduces a new communication paradigm, made of game-alike exploration of a 3D environment, virtually reconstructed, with elements of digital fiction and an engaging stortytelling, applied to two case studies: the exploration of the Hera II Temple of Paestum with Virtual Reality (VR) technology, and the exploration of the slab of the Swimmer Tomb with Augmented Reality (AR). The emotional component is fundamental in ArkaeVision, because it generates the motivation and leads people to use immersive viewers, as the HTC Vive, which allow the learning process to be activated more quickly, as many cognitivists and psychologists reported in the latest researches. Also the involvement of users through gamification is well expressed in ArkaeVision. This model of action (and interaction) designed for the public allows to emphasize the role of users through a system that is “guided” by their choices and times, in order to increase users’ engagement within the virtual exploration, and favour the content understanding by direct experience. Evaluations conducted on a preliminary prototype suggested that the communicative approach is very promising for education and engagement into cultural heritage experiences.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.daach.2019.e00124;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054819300232;;;Virtual reality, Augmented reality, Gamification, Digital storytelling, User experience design;;2212-0548;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Thematic evolution of smart learning environments, insights and directions from a 20-year research milestones: A bibliometric analysis;Della Maulidiya and Budi Nugroho and Harry B. Santoso and Zainal A. Hasibuan;Heliyon;2024;Science@Direct;e26191;;Smart learning environments (SLEs) have been developed to create an effective learning environment gradually and sustainably by applying technology. Given the growing dependence on technology daily, SLE will inevitably be incorporated into the teaching and learning process. Without transforming technology-enhanced learning environments into SLE, they are restricted to adding sophistication and lack pedagogical benefits, leading to wasteful educational investments. SLE research has grown over time, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2021, which fundamentally altered the “landscape” of technology use in education. This study aims to discover how the stages of SLE transform from time to time by applying two bibliometric analysis approaches: publication performance analysis and science mapping. The dataset was created by extracting bibliometric data from Scopus, including 427 articles, 162 publication sources (journals and proceeding), and 1080 authors from 2002 to 2022. Three kinds of SLE research subjects were identified by keyword synthesis: SLE features, technological innovation, and adaptive learning systems. Adaptive learning and personalized learning are consistently used interchangeably to demonstrate the significance of supporting the diversity of student and teacher conditions. Learning analytics, essential to employing big data technology for educational data mining, is a new theme being considered increasingly in the future to achieve adaptive and personalized learning.

;Deep reinforcement learning for the computation offloading in MIMO-based Edge Computing;Abdeladim Sadiki and Jamal Bentahar and Rachida Dssouli and Abdeslam En-Nouaary and Hadi Otrok;Ad Hoc Networks;2023;Science@Direct;103080;141;Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has recently emerged as a potential technology to serve the needs of mobile devices (MDs) in 5G and 6G cellular networks. By offloading tasks to high-performance servers installed at the edge of the wireless networks, resource-limited MDs can cope with the proliferation of the recent computationally-intensive applications. In this paper, we study the computation offloading problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based MEC system where the base stations are equipped with a large number of antennas. Our objective is to minimize the power consumption and offloading delay at the MDs under the stochastic system environment. To this end, we introduce new formulation of the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose two Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to learn the optimal offloading policy without any prior knowledge of the environment dynamics. First, a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based algorithm to solve the curse of the state space explosion is defined. Then, a more general Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based algorithm to solve the problem of discrete action space is introduced. Simulation results show that our DRL-based solutions outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, our PPO algorithm exhibits stable performance and efficient offloading results compared to the benchmarks DQN and Double DQN (DDQN) strategies.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2022.103080;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870522002529;;;Multi-access Edge Computing, Massive multiple-input multiple-output, Deep reinforcement learning, Computation offloading;;1570-8705;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Interpretable machine learning assessment;Henry Han and Yi Wu and Jiacun Wang and Ashley Han;Neurocomputing;2023;Science@Direct;126891;561;With the surge of machine learning in AI and data science, there remains an urgent need to not only compare the performance of different methods across diverse datasets but also to analyze machine learning behaviors with sensitivity using an explainable approach. In this study, we introduce a uniquely designed diagnostic index: d-index to tackle this challenge. This tool integrates classification effectiveness from multiple dimensions, delivering a transparent and comprehensive assessment that transcends the limitations of traditional evaluation methods in classification. We propose two innovative concepts: breakeven states and imbalanced points in this study. Integrated with the d-index, these concepts afford a more profound understanding of the learning behaviors across different machine learning models compared to the existing classification metrics. Significantly, the d-index excels as a powerful tool, identifying learning singularity problems (LSPs) that remain elusive to most current machine learning models and imbalanced learning techniques. Furthermore, leveraging the d-index, we unravel the mechanisms behind imbalanced point generation in binary and multiclass classification. We also put forth a novel technique: identifying a priori informative kernels to optimize support vector machine learning, ensuring outstanding d-index values with the fewest necessary support vectors. Moreover, we address a seldom-discussed state of overfitting in deep learning, where overfitting occurs despite the training and testing loss curves exhibiting favorable trends throughout the epochs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents a pioneering stride in the realm of explainable machine learning assessments and will inspire further studies in this area.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2023.126891;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231223010147;;;D-index, Interpretability, Breakeven, Imbalanced point, Learning singularity problems;;0925-2312;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Towards computational analytics of 3D neuron images using deep adversarial learning;Zhongyu Li and Xiayue Fan and Zengyi Shang and Lina Zhang and Haotian Zhen and Chaowei Fang;Neurocomputing;2021;Science@Direct;323-333;438;Benefited from advances of neuron tracing techniques, the ever-increasing number of digitally reconstructed 3D neuron images have greatly facilitated the research in neuromorphology. However, the sheer volume and the complexity of these 3D neuron data pose significant challenges for computational analytics, e.g., effectively finding neurons sharing similar morphologies, identifying neuron types, correlating neuron morphologies with properties, all of which require accurate measuring and fast indexing methods especially designed for the massive 3D neuronal images. In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient framework for the computational analytics of 3D neuronal structures based on advances of deep learning and data mining techniques. Particularly, unlike previous methods quantitatively describe neurons by measuring pre-defined metrics according to the tree-topological structures, we first develop a new method for the morphological feature representation by a proposed 3D neuron mapping and a modified generative adversarial networks (GANs). Subsequently, considering the computational complexity when retrieving large-scale neuron datasets, we integrate the neuron features with graph-based indexing, which can significantly improve the retrieval efficiency without losing accuracy. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively measure the similarity among massive neurons (e.g., 100,000 neurons), outperforming state-of-the-arts with more than 10% in accuracy and hundreds of times in efficiency improvements.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.03.129;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221001028;;;Computational neuroscience, 3D neuron image, Neuronal morphology, Generative adversarial networks, Large-scale retrieval;;0925-2312;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

First, the method needs to consider how to encourage devices to cooperate when they are selfish. Second, the method answers the following question: how can collaborative computing be carried out when the device has the intention to cooperate? For example, how can calculations be conducted when there are extensibility and privacy problems in machine learning tasks? In view of the above challenges, a mobile edge server is taken as the focus, and the available resources around the mobile edge server are used for collaborative computing to further improve the computing performance of a mobile edge computing (MEC) system. The alternating direction multiplier method is used to solve the problem. First, the relevant techniques and theories of MEC, Stackelberg principle-subordinate game theory, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are introduced.

Despite the wide interest, a systematic map of CT through programming in higher education is still missing. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we aim to provide a systematic map of the relevant research by identifying the areas and sub-areas of CT through programming teaching and learning in higher education. Second, we aim to investigate these areas based on two dimensions: their evolution over the years and the branches to which CT is applied. For this purpose, we apply a systematic mapping methodology. Main results include the identification of the CT areas of Knowledge Base, Assessment, Learning Strategies, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building. Of these, Knowledge Base, Assessment and Tools have significantly evolved throughout the years, while Capacity Building has only recently emerged. In addition, the introduction of CT to undergraduate students and preservice teachers differs mainly in the tools used and the CT elements that are assessed.

Nevertheless, a knowledge-trust gap persists between consumers and the dairy industry. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we developed an immersive virtual farm simulation to provide realistic on-farm experiences to the public. Within the virtual farm, users can explore various sites where dairy cows are raised and gain insights into dairy production processes using a head-mounted display (HMD). This simulation was demonstrated at local libraries, involving 48 public participants. We collected and analyzed participants’ feedback on various aspects, including usability and their overall perceptions, to assess the simulation’s effectiveness as an agricultural education tool. We investigated the impact of the virtual experience on participants’ perceived knowledge gain and their awareness of the dairy industry. The results indicate that our dairy farm simulation was positively received as an effective tool for public education.

Recently, due to the remarkable performance of deep models, deep MVL has been adopted in many domains, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision. This paper presents a comprehensive review on deep MVL from the following two perspectives: MVL methods in deep learning scope and deep MVL extensions of traditional methods. Specifically, we first review the representative MVL methods in the scope of deep learning, such as multi-view auto-encoder, conventional neural networks and deep brief networks. Then, we investigate the advancements of the MVL mechanism when traditional learning methods meet deep learning models, such as deep multi-view canonical correlation analysis, matrix factorization and information bottleneck.

An expansive tabular database was created using the LMC for eight distinct gestures and the SSC algorithm was used for discerning and selecting salient features. This refined feature subset is then utilized in the subsequent training of a DNN model. A comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of the SSC algorithm in comparison with established optimization techniques, such as Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer(GWO), and Sine Cosine Algorithm(SCA), specifically in the context of feature selection. The empirical findings decisively establish the efficacy of the SSC algorithm, consistently achieving a high accuracy rate of 98% in the domain of gesture recognition tasks.

;TransCNNLoc: End-to-end pixel-level learning for 2D-to-3D pose estimation in dynamic indoor scenes;Shengjun Tang and Yusong Li and Jiawei Wan and You Li and Baoding Zhou and Renzhong Guo and Weixi Wang and Yuhong Feng;ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing;2024;Science@Direct;218-230;207;Accurate localization in GPS-denied environments has always been a core issue in computer vision and robotics research. In indoor environments, vision-based localization methods are susceptible to changes in lighting conditions, viewing angles, and environmental factors, resulting in localization failures or limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose the TransCNNLoc framework, which consists of an encoding–decoding network designed to learn more robust image features for camera pose estimation. In the image feature encoding stage, CNN and Swin Transformer are integrated to construct the image feature encoding module, enabling the network to fully extract global context and local features from images. In the decoding stage, multi-level image features are decoded through cross-layer connections while computing per-pixel feature weight maps. To enhance the framework’s robustness to dynamic objects, a dynamic object recognition network is introduced to optimize the feature weights. Finally, a multi-level iterative optimization from coarse to fine levels is performed to recover six degrees of freedom camera pose. Experiments were conducted on the publicly available 7scenes dataset as well as a dataset collected under changing lighting conditions and dynamic scenes for accuracy validation and analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TransCNNLoc framework exhibits superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and lighting changes. In the context of static environments within publicly available datasets, the localization technique introduced in this study attains a maximal precision of up to 5 centimeters, consistently achieving superior outcomes across a majority of the scenarios. Under the conditions of dynamic scenes and fluctuating illumination, this approach demonstrates an enhanced precision capability, reaching up to 3 centimeters. This represents a substantial refinement from the decimeter scale to a centimeter scale in precision, marking a significant advancement over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.

Welch;International Journal of Human-Computer Studies;2022;Science@Direct;102838;165;"Past research highlights the potential for leveraging both humans and animals as social support figures in one’s real life to enhance performance and reduce physiological and psychological stress. Some studies have shown that typically dogs are more effective than people. Various situational and interpersonal circumstances limit the opportunities for receiving support from actual animals in the real world introducing the need for alternative approaches. To that end, advances in augmented reality (AR) technology introduce new opportunities for realizing and investigating virtual dogs as social support figures. In this paper, we report on a within-subjects 3x1 (i.e., no support, virtual human, or virtual dog) experimental design study with 33 participants. We examined the effect on performance, attitude towards the task and the support figure, and stress and anxiety measured through both subjective questionnaires and heart rate data. Our mixed-methods analysis revealed that participants significantly preferred, and more positively evaluated, the virtual dog support figure than the other conditions. Emerged themes from a qualitative analysis of our participants’ post-study interview responses are aligned with these findings as some of our participants mentioned feeling more comfortable with the virtual dog compared to the virtual human although the virtual human was deemed more interactive. We did not find significant differences between our conditions in terms of change in average heart rate; however, average heart rate significantly increased during all conditions. Our research contributes to understanding how AR virtual support dogs can potentially be used to provide social support to people in stressful situations, especially when real support figures cannot be present.

Thanks to the mentioned technologies, these mobile devices can run critical business/entertainment applications such as Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, vehicular networks, and media streaming. However, due to such devices' inherent limitations, some emerging computation environments such as Mobile Edge Computing have been introduced to achieve some essential requirements such as low latency, low energy consumption, and low cost. In the literature, offloading is a technique to transfer the burden of the mobile devices' work incurred by running applications' requests to these computation environments. On the other hand, exploring the computation environment to find the most efficient place to execute such requests is challenging work to achieve. In addition, different researches have been proposed to cope with the management problems of the offloading criterion. In this paper, an autonomous computation offloading framework is proposed to address some challenges related to time-intensive and resource-intensive applications. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the proposed autonomous framework has not been explored as a control model for self-management in the computation offloading criterion. Besides, to cope with the large dimension of the offloading decision-making problem, different simulations including Deep Neural Networks, multiple linear regression, hybrid model, and Hidden Markov Model as the planning module of the mentioned autonomous methodology have been conducted. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid model can appropriately fit the problem with near-optimal accuracy regarding the offloading decision-making, the latency, and the energy consumption predictions in the proposed self-management framework.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2021.102974;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804521000011;;;Offloading, Mobile edge computing, Machine learning, Neural networks, Hidden markov model, Regression;;1084-8045;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Federated learning for 5G and beyond, a blessing and a curse- an experimental study on intrusion detection systems;Taki Eddine Toufik Djaidja and Bouziane Brik and Abdelwahab Boualouache and Sidi Mohammed Senouci and Yacine Ghamri-Doudane;Computers & Security;2024;Science@Direct;103707;139;5G's service providers now leverage Deep Learning (DL) to automate their network slice management, provisioning, and security. To this end, each slice owner contributes data to feed a common dataset used to train centralized learning models. However, this method raises privacy considerations that prevent its usage. Therefore, Federated learning (FL), a collaborative approach that ensures data privacy, is being investigated while striving toward the same performance as centralized learning. As 5G and beyond services are so diverse, the local slice's data is not intended to reflect the entire data distribution. Thus, local data of slices are Non-Independently and non-Identically distributed (Non-IID), posing a challenge for FL-based models. In this paper, we investigate the use of FL to secure network slices and detect potential attacks. For that purpose, we first propose an architecture for deploying intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in 5G and beyond networks. Next, we thoroughly evaluate the latest state-of-art FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedPer, and SCAFFOLD, in the context of Independently and Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-IID data distributions. We compare these FL models to centralized and local DL models. We find that SCAFFOLD outperforms all the other FL algorithms and ensures a stable learning loss convergence, a promising finding that strengthens the case for leveraging FL in IDS development. Nevertheless, none of the FL models could achieve the centralized model's performance in Non-IID scenarios.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2024.103707;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404824000087;;;Federated learning, Deep learning, IDS, NON-IID, 5G and beyond;;0167-4048;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;A Cross-Domain Systematic Mapping Study on Software Engineering for Digital Twins;Manuela Dalibor and Nico Jansen and Bernhard Rumpe and David Schmalzing and Louis Wachtmeister and Manuel Wimmer and Andreas Wortmann;Journal of Systems and Software;2022;Science@Direct;111361;193;Digital Twins are currently investigated as the technological backbone for providing an enhanced understanding and management of existing systems as well as for designing new systems in various domains, e.g., ranging from single manufacturing components such as sensors to large-scale systems such as smart cities. Given the diverse application domains of Digital Twins, it is not surprising that the characterization of the term Digital Twin, as well as the needs for developing and operating Digital Twins are multi-faceted. Providing a better understanding what the commonalities and differences of Digital Twins in different contexts are, may allow to build reusable support for developing, running, and managing Digital Twins by providing dedicated concepts, techniques, and tool support. In this paper, we aim to uncover the nature of Digital Twins based on a systematic mapping study which is not limited to a particular application domain or technological space. We systematically retrieved a set of 1471 unique publications of which 356 were selected for further investigation. In particular, we analyzed the types of research and contributions made for Digital Twins, the expected properties Digital Twins have to fulfill, how Digital Twins are realized and operated, as well as how Digital Twins are finally evaluated. Based on this analysis, we also contribute a novel feature model for Digital Twins from a software engineering perspective as well as several observations to further guide future software engineering research in this area.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2022.111361;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121222000917;;;Software Engineering, Digital Twins, Manufacturing, Industry 4.0;;0164-1212;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;On the feasibility of Federated Learning towards on-demand client deployment at the edge;Mario Chahoud and Safa Otoum and Azzam Mourad;Information Processing & Management;2023;Science@Direct;103150;60;Nowadays, researchers are investing their time and devoting their efforts in developing and motivating the 6G vision and resources that are not available in 5G. Edge computing and autonomous vehicular driving applications are more enhanced under the 6G services that are provided to successfully operate tasks. The huge volume of data resulting from such applications can be a plus in the AI and Machine Learning (ML) world. Traditional ML models are used to train their models on centralized data sets. Lately, data privacy becomes a real aspect to take into consideration while collecting data. For that, Federated Learning (FL) plays nowadays a great role in addressing privacy and technology together by maintaining the ability to learn over decentralized data sets. The training is limited to the user devices only while sharing the locally computed parameter with the server that aggregates those updated weights to optimize a global model. This scenario is repeated multiple rounds for better results and convergence. Most of the literature proposed client selection methods to converge faster and increase accuracy. However, none of them has targeted the ability to deploy and select clients in real-time wherever and whenever needed. In fact, some mobile and vehicular devices are not available to serve as clients in the FL due to the highly dynamic environments and/or do not have the capabilities to accomplish this task. In this paper, we address the aforementioned limitations by introducing an on-demand client deployment in FL offering more volume and heterogeneity of data in the learning process. We make use of containerization technology such as Docker to build efficient environments using any type of client devices serving as volunteering devices, and Kubernetes utility called Kubeadm to monitor the devices. The performed experiments illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach and the efficiency of the deployment of clients whenever and wherever needed.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103150;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457322002515;;;Edge computing, 6G, Artificial Intelligence, Federated Learning, Privacy, On-demand client deployment;;0306-4573;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

However, an accurate prediction would assist educators and learning experts in the extraction of useful knowledge for designing learning interventions for improving teams’ outcomes. The main objective of the current paper is to explore and propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework for binary classification with two hidden layers, for the early prediction of teams’ performance in the domain of software engineering. The framework was evaluated by using different activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLu, and Tanh) and optimizers (Adagrad and Adadelta). A dataset created from over 30000 entries grouped in 74 teams was used for training and evaluating the framework. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was used to interpret the framework and extract the most important features having a positive or negative impact on its final prediction. Among other conclusions, it was shown that the prediction accuracy of the framework, when the Adadelta and Adagrad optimizers were used, was found to be 76.73% and 82.39%, respectively, while its overall learning performance was 80.76% and 86.57%, meaning that it is capable of predicting teams’ performance adequately and accurately.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107355;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494621002787;;;Deep neural network, Team performance prediction, Collaboration, Machine learning, Computer-assisted learning;;1568-4946;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

A smartphone-based AR application was developed to support the workflow of producing special components based on AM. The developed app fosters the evaluation of individually engineered parts based on virtual three-dimensional (3D)-computer-aided design (CAD) models projected to the intended installation-site. This supports the detection of problems caused by inaccessible raw measurements or difficult to anticipate movements of the produced parts. The designed app was tested in a real-world industrial setting. In total, six production engineers conducted 12 test runs. The tests were video recorded and complemented by questionnaires. Both data sources served as a basis for the conducted analysis aiming to evaluate this case.

;An examination of mobile phone pointing in surface mapped spatial augmented reality;Jeremy Hartmann and Daniel Vogel;International Journal of Human-Computer Studies;2021;Science@Direct;102662;153;We investigate mobile phone pointing in Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR), where digital content is mapped onto the surfaces of a real physical environment. Three pointing techniques are compared: raycast, viewport, and direct. A first experiment examines these techniques in a realistic five-projector SAR environment with representative targets distributed across different surfaces. Participants were permitted free movement, so variations in target occlusion and target view angle occurred naturally. A second experiment validates and further generalizes findings by strictly controlling target occlusion and view angle in a simulated SAR pointing task using an AR HMD. Overall, results show raycast is fastest for non-occluded targets, direct is most accurate, and fastest for occluded targets in close proximity, and viewport falls in between. Using the experiment data, we formulate and evaluate a new Fitts’ model combining two spatial configurations in a SAR pointing task to capture key characteristics, initial target occlusion, target view angle, and user movement. Analysis shows it is a better predictor than previous models.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2021.102662;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107158192100080X;;;Augmented reality, Mobile input, Pointing, Fitts’ modeling;;1071-5819;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Novel method for augmented reality guided endodontics: An in vitro study;Marco Farronato and Andres Torres and Mariano S. Pedano and Reinhilde Jacobs;Journal of Dentistry;2023;Science@Direct;104476;132;"Objective
The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy in endodontics of a novel augmented reality (AR) method for guided access cavity preparation in 3D-printed jaws.
Methods
Two operators with different levels of experience in endodontics performed pre-planned virtually guided access cavities through a novel markerless AR system on three sets of 3D-printed jaw models (Objet Connex 350, Stratasys) mounted on a phantom. After the treatment, a post-operative high-resolution CBCT scan (NewTom VGI Evo, Cefla) was taken for each model and registered to the pre-operative model. All the access cavities were then digitally reconstructed by filling the cavity area using 3D medical software (3-Matic 15.0, materialize). For the anterior teeth and the premolars, the deviation at the coronal and apical entry points as well as the angular deviation of the access cavity were compared to the virtual plan. For the molars, the deviation at the coronal entry point was compared to the virtual plan. Additionally, the surface area of all access cavities at the entry point was measured and compared to the virtual plan. Descriptive statistics for each parameter were performed. A 95% confidence interval was calculated.
Results
A total of 90 access cavities were drilled up to a depth of 4 mm inside the tooth. The mean deviation in the frontal teeth and in the premolars at the entry point was 0.51 mm and 0.77 mm at the apical point, with a mean angular deviation of 8.5° and a mean surface overlap of 57%. The mean deviation for the molars at the entry point was 0.63 mm, with a mean surface overlap of 82%.
Conclusion
The use of AR as a digital guide for endodontic access cavity drilling on different teeth showed promising results and might have potential for clinical use. However, further development and research might be needed before in vivo validation.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2023.104476;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571223000635;;;Visual-inertial odometry, Guided endodontics, Augmented reality, Cone-beam computed tomography, Minimal invasive endodontics;;0300-5712;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

In this work, the physical systems are operations and processes from energy-intensive industrial plants and their local communities. The creation of DTs demands expertise not just in engineering, but also in computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence.

These attributes are self-learning, self-optimizing, self-evolving, self-monitoring, and self-protection. This new approach merges cutting-edge computing with pragmatic engineering needs.

;A critical analysis of image-based camera pose estimation techniques;Meng Xu and Youchen Wang and Bin Xu and Jun Zhang and Jian Ren and Zhao Huang and Stefan Poslad and Pengfei Xu;Neurocomputing;2024;Science@Direct;127125;570;Camera, and associated with its objects within the field of view, localization could benefit many computer vision fields, such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, and augmented reality (AR). After decades of progress, camera localization, also called camera pose estimation could compute the 6DoF pose of objects for a camera in a given image, with respect to different images in a sequence or formats. Structure feature-based localization methods have achieved great success when integrated with image matching or with a coordinate regression stage. Absolute and relative pose regression methods using transfer learning can support end-to-end localization to directly regress a camera pose but achieve a less accurate performance. Despite the rapid development of multiple branches in this area, a comprehensive, in-depth and comparative analysis is lacking to summarize, classify and compare, structure feature-based and regression-based camera localization methods. Existing surveys either focus on larger SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems or on only part of the camera localization method, lack detailed comparisons and descriptions of the methods or datasets used, neural network designs such as loss designs, and input formats, etc. In this survey, we first introduce specific application areas and the evaluation metrics for camera localization pose according to different sub-tasks (learning-based 2D-2D task, 2D-3D task, and 3D-3D task). Then, we review common methods for structure feature-based camera pose estimation approaches, absolute pose regression and relative pose regression approaches by critically modelling the methods to inspire further improvements in their algorithms such as loss functions, and neural network structures. Furthermore, we summarize what are the popular datasets used for camera localization and compare the quantitative and qualitative results of these methods with detailed performance metrics.

Data are more and more accessible, potentially allowing making better decisions at all the level of the company. Then, job profiles and their required skills are changing. However, if competencies focused on software tools, programming, data analysis, simulation, virtual design, automatics and electronics becomes necessary, the initial trainings and continuous trainings are not changing as fast. Moreover, if new technologies are more available in companies, the workforce suffers of a lack of preparation. It generates risks of mistakes, improper use of tools and information, under performed activities, insufficiently informed decision. A global vision of how to train the whole industrial network is necessary to generate a progress of the whole industry.

Applied coaching in augmented reality (AR) has rarely been utilized in school physical education. Visual coaching has also been used in athletic activities, but it neither includes immersive practice nor equally embodies academic learning and athletic skills. Recently, techno pedagogical methods have been introduced to utilize constructive teaching and learning progressions through information communication techniques (ICT). The main goal of this work is to analyze the effect of teaching by applying increased physical education realities for spatial orientation creation and acquisition in contrast to conventional exhibition education. To educate school students in physical education advancements, the AR method of training is efficient, particularly to obtain better performance in students' engagement in sports. However, the massively augmented reality renderings limit the operating environment to a costlier, high-complexity integrated unit, and it is impossible to run AR simulations on normal computers.

Collazos and Francisco Luis {Gutiérrez Vela} and Fernando Moreira;Telematics and Informatics;2019;Science@Direct;62-73;38;The pervasive games (PG) have had a great reception in recent years. This kind of games combines the virtual world with the real world to generate extensions of reality in terms of time, space and social interaction. These extensions have involved users in experiences as varied as those exposed by augmented reality and the location of the player or mixed reality scenarios. In the educational context, games have been integrated little by little into learning processes. Specifically, PG have shown to have a higher level of immersion in people's daily activities. Therefore, a greater impact is generated when integrating the technologies of the PG and the narrative of a story that is told through the gaming experience. In order to explore some fields, we focus the study on the narrative and geolocation applied to close spaces, it is a way of giving an enriched experience to the player through a digital transformation perspective. For this reason, it is necessary to have a platform that allows the creation and edition of PG based on narrative to increase the motivation of higher education students. This article describes the creation of a platform that integrates tools for creating stories and editing narrative content in the game experiences. The main objective is focused on increasing the motivation of students in educational processes.

;Review the state-of-the-art technologies of semantic segmentation based on deep learning;Yujian Mo and Yan Wu and Xinneng Yang and Feilin Liu and Yujun Liao;Neurocomputing;2022;Science@Direct;626-646;493;The goal of semantic segmentation is to segment the input image according to semantic information and predict the semantic category of each pixel from a given label set. With the gradual intellectualization of modern life, more and more applications need to infer relevant semantic information from images for subsequent processing, such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, video surveillance, etc. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technologies of semantic segmentation based on deep learning. Because semantic segmentation requires a large number of pixel-level annotations, in order to reduce the fine-grained requirements of annotation and reduce the economic and time cost of manual annotation, this paper studies the works on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. In order to enhance the generalization ability and robustness of the segmentation model, this paper investigates the works on domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. Many types of sensors are usually equipped in some practical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. In order to mine the association between multi-modal data and improve the accuracy of the segmentation model, this paper investigates the works based on multi-modal data fusion semantic segmentation. The real-time performance of the model needs to be considered in practical application. This paper analyzes the key factors affecting the real-time performance of the segmentation model and investigates the works on real-time semantic segmentation. Finally, this paper summarizes the challenges and promising research directions of semantic segmentation tasks based on deep learning.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.01.005;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231222000054;;;Deep learning, Convolutional neural networks, Semantic segmentation, Real-time, Domain adaptation, Multi-modal fusion, Weakly-supervised;;0925-2312;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Learning disentangled representation for self-supervised video object segmentation;Wenjie Hou and Zheyun Qin and Xiaoming Xi and Xiankai Lu and Yilong Yin;Neurocomputing;2022;Science@Direct;270-280;481;This paper proposes a novel self-supervised method for one-shot video object segmentation where the object annotations are only provided in the first frame. The current self-supervised video object segmentation approaches are implemented by modeling the pairwise correspondence between the target and reference frames. The pairwise correspondence only maintains spatio-temporal consistency. However, the VOS tasks not only require a spatio-temporal relationship between the two frames but also require the salient object information for each frame. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a disentangled representation strategy to disentangle the temporal correspondence into the pairwise term and unary term. The pairwise and unary terms capture inter-frame spatio-temporal and intra-frame salient object information, respectively. To demonstrate the importance of the disentangled representation, we apply the proposed approach to DAVIS-2017 and YouTube-VOS datasets. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.01.066;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231222000856;;;Self-supervised video object segmentation, Disentangled representation, Pair-wise term, Unary term;;0925-2312;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;BiPR-RL: Portrait relighting via bi-directional consistent deep reinforcement learning;Yukai Song and Guangxin Xu and Xiaoyan Zhang and Zhijun Zhang;Computer Vision and Image Understanding;2024;Science@Direct;103889;239;Portrait relighting via deep reinforcement learning could conduct portrait relighting by sequentially predicting local light editing strokes, simulating image editing by artists using brush strokes. It is a locally effective, scale-invariant and interpretable method, which yields state-of-the-art results in relighting wild portrait images. However, it still has problems due to the lack of supervision information on intermediate processes, which makes the reinforcement learning agent not receive sufficient feedback during the exploration process. This will cause incorrect strokes in the relighting. To further optimize the relighting effect, we take advantage of the fact that the light editing actions are invertible and the inverse actions can generate a backward sequence of states. The backward state sequence also provide useful supervision signals as they convey information about the future states given the action choices. Therefore, we propose to combine the forward and the backward state sequence predictions to improve the learning efficiency for portrait relighting. Using the bi-directional state sequences, we design corresponding bi-directional consistent rewards to guide the model to explore the actions with higher accuracy to maximize the performance of the proposed method. The proposed approach is used for portrait relighting tasks based on both SH-lighting and reference images. The results show that our method has further improved the performance by avoiding wrong strokes. Meanwhile, our method performs better than SOTA methods in producing locally effective relighting images for wild portrait images.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103889;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314223002692;;;Bi-directional, Portrait relighting, Deep reinforcement learning;;1077-3142;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;The consolidation of game software engineering: A systematic literature review of software engineering for industry-scale computer games;Jorge Chueca and Javier Verón and Jaime Font and Francisca Pérez and Carlos Cetina;Information and Software Technology;2024;Science@Direct;107330;165;"Context:
Game Software Engineering (GSE) is a branch of Software Engineering (SE) that focuses on the development of video game applications. In past years, GSE has achieved enough volume, differences from traditional software engineering, and interest by the community to be considered an independent scientific domain, veering out from traditional SE.
Objective:
This study evaluates the current state of the art in software engineering for industry-scale computer games identifying gaps and consolidating the magnitude and growth of this field.
Method:
A Systematic Literature Review is performed following best practices to ensure the relevance of the studies included in the review. We analyzed 98 GSE studies to extract the current intensity, topics, methods, and quality of GSE.
Results:
The GSE research community has been growing over the years, producing over four times more research than before the previous GSE survey. However, this community is still very dispersed, with no main venues holding most of the GSE scientific studies. A broader range of topics is covered in this area, evolving towards those of a mature field such as architecture and design. Also, the reviewed studies employ more elaborated empirical research methods, even though the study reports need to be more rigorous in sections related to the critical examination of the work.
Conclusion:
The results of the SLR lead to the identification of 13 potential future research directions for this domain. GSE is an independent, mature, and growing field that presents new ways of software creation where the gap between industry and academia is narrowing. Video games present themselves as powerful tools to push the boundaries of software knowledge.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2023.107330;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584923001854;;;Computer games, Video games, Game software engineering, Systematic literature review, SLR, Industry-scale;;0950-5849;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;AGILEST approach: Using machine learning agents to facilitate kinesthetic learning in STEM education through real-time touchless hand interaction;Muhammad {Zahid Iqbal} and Abraham G. Campbell;Telematics and Informatics Reports;2023;Science@Direct;100034;9;There is an increasing interest in creating interactive learning applications using innovative interaction technologies, especially in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects. Recent developments in machine learning have allowed for nearly perfect hand-tracking recognition, introducing a touchless modality for interaction within Augmented Reality (AR) environments. However, the research community has not explored the pedagogical approach of Kinesthetic Learning or “Learning by Doing”, hand tracking, and machine learning agents combined with Augmented Reality technology. Fundamentally, this exploration of touchless interaction technologies has taken on new importance in the new post-COVID world. Meanwhile, machine learning has gained attention for its ability to enhance personalized learning and play a vital new role as a virtual instructor. This paper proposes a novel approach called the AGILEST approach, which uses machine learning Agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in STEM education through touchless interaction. The first case study for this approach will be an AR learning application for chemistry. This application uses real-time touchless hand interaction for kinesthetic learning and uses a machine learning agent to act as both trainer and assessor of the user. The evaluation of this research has been conducted remotely through a usability study with expert reviewers, which includes 15 young researchers with peer-reviewed work in Human-Computer Interaction & AR and 2 subject experts STEM teachers at the secondary school level. The usability evaluation through NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), Perceived Ease of Use (PUEU), and Perceived Usefulness (PU) with expert reviewers provide positive feedback about this approach for productive learning gain, engagement and interactiveness in learning STEM subjects.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.teler.2022.100034;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772503022000329;;;Augmented reality, Technology enhanced learning, Touchless hand interaction, Machine learning, Learning technology;;2772-5030;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Near-optimal and learning-driven task offloading in a 5G multi-cell mobile edge cloud;Qiufen Xia and Zheng Lou and Wenzheng Xu and Zichuan Xu;Computer Networks;2020;Science@Direct;107276;176;With development well underway, 5G is envisioned as an enabler of lighting fast mobile services, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, live video analytics, and etc. In particular, multi-cell Mobile Edge Clouds (MEC) with 5G base stations endowed with computing capability are able to promote the Quality of Services (QoS) of mobile users by executing tasks in the edge cloud. Due to the varying 5G network conditions and limited computation capacity of each base station in the multi-cell MEC, as well as the stringent QoS requirements, a fundamental and challenging problem is how to offload user tasks to the edge cloud, such that the energy consumption of mobile devices is minimized. In this paper, we first formulate the offline and online location-aware mobile task offloading problems in a multi-cell MEC. For the offline location-aware mobile task offloading problem, we then develop an exact solution and an approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio. For the online problem, we thirdly propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based offloading algorithm for mobile users to obtain the optimal offloading policy. We finally conduct extensive experiments by simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithms against existing benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are promising and outperform the benchmark algorithms by significantly reducing energy cost of mobile devices and delays experienced by mobile users.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107276;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128620301699;;;Task offloading, Mobile edge computing, Approximation algorithm;;1389-1286;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Continually improving learners ‘experience, gamifying e-learning appeared with one objective: of motivation, attendance and progress of e-learners. One size of gamification isn’t suitable for all learners. Learners do not interact with gamification element or gamification environment in the same way which brings the appearance of personalized gamification which has proven its effectiveness to improve learner engagement, motivation and learning results. To understand which mechanisms and dynamics create pleasure, several concepts revolve around to personalized gamification. A learner in the context of adaptive gamification has different changing aspects like personalities, needs, values and motivations, we are going to combine those aspects with learner experience to adapt gamification process.

;A systematic review of immersive virtual reality applications for higher education: Design elements, lessons learned, and research agenda;Jaziar Radianti and Tim A. Majchrzak and Jennifer Fromm and Isabell Wohlgenannt;Computers & Education;2020;Science@Direct;103778;147;Researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (VR) in different scenarios. VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103778;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131519303276;;;Augmented and virtual reality, Cooperative/collaborative learning, Distance education and online learning, Human–computer interface, Media in education;;0360-1315;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Basic relationships refer to supporting customers and people responsible for services offering for these customers. The aim of the paper is to analyze and evaluate the state-of-the art of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the hospitality industry. Our findings show that the major deployments concern in-person customer services, chatbots and messaging tools, business intelligence tools powered by machine learning, and virtual reality & augmented reality. Moreover, we performed a survey (n = 178), asking respondents about their perceptions and attitudes toward AI, including its implementation within a hotel space. The paper attempts to discuss how the hotel industry can be motivated by potential customers to apply selected AI solutions. In our opinion, these results provide useful insights for understanding the phenomenon under investigation. Nevertheless, since the results are not conclusive, more research is still needed on this topic. Future studies may concern both qualitative and quantitative methods, devoted to developing models that: a) quantify the potential benefits and risks of AI implementations, b) determine and evaluate the factors affecting the AI adoption by the customers, and c) measure the user (guest) experience of the hotel services, fueled by AI-based technologies.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.09.233;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921019724;;;Artificial Intelligence, Hotel Industry, Applications;;1877-0509;;Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference KES2021;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;A comparative study on online machine learning techniques for network traffic streams analysis;Amin Shahraki and Mahmoud Abbasi and Amir Taherkordi and Anca Delia Jurcut;Computer Networks;2022;Science@Direct;108836;207;Modern networks generate a massive amount of traffic data streams. Analyzing this data is essential for various purposes, such as network resources management and cyber-security analysis. There is an urgent need for data analytic methods that can perform network data processing in an online manner based on the arrival of new data. Online machine learning (OL) techniques promise to support such type of data analytics. In this paper, we investigate and compare the OL techniques that facilitate data stream analytics in the networking domain. We also investigate the importance of traffic data analytics and highlight the advantages of online learning in this regard, as well as the challenges associated with OL-based network traffic stream analysis, e.g., concept drift and the imbalanced classes. We review the data stream processing tools and frameworks that can be used to process such data online or on-the-fly along with their pros and cons, and their integrability with de facto data processing frameworks. To explore the performance of OL techniques, we conduct an empirical evaluation on the performance of different ensemble- and tree-based algorithms for network traffic classification. Finally, the open issues and the future directions in analyzing traffic data streams are presented.

;A case study for risk assessment in AR-equipped socio-technical systems;Soheila {Sheikh Bahaei} and Barbara Gallina and Marko Vidović;Journal of Systems Architecture;2021;Science@Direct;102250;119;Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are used as human–machine interface within various types of safety-critical systems. Several studies have shown that AR improves human performance. However, the introduction of AR might introduce risks due to new types of dependability threats. In order to avoid unreasonable risk, it is required to detect new types of dependability threats (faults, errors, failures). In our previous work, we have designed extensions for the SafeConcert metamodel (a metamodel for modeling socio-technical systems) to capture AR-related dependability threats (focusing on faults and failures). Despite the availability of various modeling techniques, there has been no detailed investigation of providing an integrated framework for risk assessment in AR-equipped socio-technical systems. Hence, in this paper, we provide an integrated framework based on our previously proposed extensions. In addition, in cooperation with our industrial partners, active in the automotive domain, we design and execute a case study. We aim at verifying the modeling and analysis capabilities of our framework and finding out if the proposed extensions are helpful in capturing system risks caused by new AR-related dependability threats.

(AR Mobile Application);Murad Al-Rajab and Samia Loucif and Ossama Kousi and Mohamad Bassem Irani;Alexandria Engineering Journal;2022;Science@Direct;8573-8584;61;Technology is continuously evolving at an exponential rate. Fast technological advances are being made, especially in the field of smart phones, that facilitate the conduct of our daily activities in many areas such as driving. The ever-increasing number of vehicles on roads increases the likelihood of traffic accidents, resulting in higher number of deaths and serious injuries to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Among the main causes of road accidents are over speeding, unsafe lane jumping, and failure to keep a safe distance between vehicles, to name a few. In an attempt to contribute to the improvement of road traffic safety, we have developed an Augmented Reality-based Smart Vehicle Driver Assistance application. The application is designed to enhance vehicle driver’s safety, in particular, but is also considered to lead to incremental improvement of safety of road traffic. The application can run on both Android and iOS platforms and incorporates several beneficial features required by a vehicle driver such as monitoring of vehicle speed, warning the driver in case of lane deviation, detection of road signs, and to alert the driver if the vehicle is not being driven at a safe distance from the vehicle in front. In addition to providing information to improve safe driving, the application also helps the vehicle driver save parking location of the vehicle in order to efficiently identify the parking location when retrieving the vehicle. This feature is very useful at large and unfamiliar parking areas, such as at airports or one-off large public gatherings, especially in inclement weather. The application also includes other useful functions such as the payment of parking fees, storage of information regarding vehicle maintenance, and keeping the vehicle legal document up to date. The application uses the stored information to display reminders of the appropriate action that needs to be taken before it becomes overdue.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2022.01.069;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016822000849;;;Smart application, Safe driving, Road safety, Augmented reality;;1110-0168;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

In the recent years, an increasing number of learning factories address the topic of digitalization. Nevertheless, the content of already existing training sessions mainly involves demonstrations of technologies rather than encouraging participants to develop their own creative solutions and implement them. For this reason, a digitalization training program has been developed in the LEAD Factory of the Institute of Innovation and Industrial Management at Graz University of Technology.

;Security computing resource allocation based on deep reinforcement learning in serverless multi-cloud edge computing;Hang Zhang and Jinsong Wang and Hongwei Zhang and Chao Bu;Future Generation Computer Systems;2024;Science@Direct;152-161;151;Handling computationally intensive tasks is challenging for user devices (UDs) with limited computing resources. Serverless cloud edge computing solves this problem and reduces maintenance and management. Its crucial function is to allocate computing resources reasonably. However, linking multiple computing resource nodes to perform computing resource allocation and ensure data security is a significant challenge. This study proposes an approach based on action-constrained deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to allocate computing resources securely. First, we consider a model of a serverless multi-cloud edge computing network with multiple computing resource nodes that possess various attribute characteristics. Then, we design a security mechanism to guarantee data security. Afterward, we formalize the network model and objectives and further transform them into a modeling process known as the Markov decision process. Finally, we propose DRL based on action constraints to provide an optimal resource allocation scheduling policy. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can reduce system costs and improve working performance compared with the comparison schemes.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2023.09.016;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X23003461;;;Serverless cloud edge computing, Resource allocation, Deep reinforcement learning;;0167-739X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;The AREA Algorithm Framework Enabling Location-based Mobile Augmented Reality Applications;Marc Schickler and Manfred Reichert and Philip Geiger and Micha Weilbach and Rüdiger Pryss;Procedia Computer Science;2019;Science@Direct;193-200;155;The dramatically increased computational capabilities of mobile devices have leveraged the opportunities for mobile application engineers. Respective scenarios, in which these opportunities can be exploited, emerge almost per day. In this context, mobile augmented reality applications play an important role in many business scenarios. In the automotive domain, they are mainly used to provide car customers with new experiences. For example, customers can use their own mobile device to experience the interior of a car by moving the mobile device around. The device’s camera then detects interior parts and shows additional information to the customer within the camera view. Although the computational capabilities have been increased, the realization of such mobile augmented reality applications is still a complex endeavor. In particular, the different mobile operating systems and their peculiarities must be carefully considered. In the AREA (Augmented Reality Engine Application) project, a powerful kernel was realized that enables location-based mobile augmented reality applications. This kernel, in turn, mainly focuses on robustness and performance. In addition, it provides a flexible architecture that fosters the development of individual location-based mobile augmented reality applications. As many aspects have to be considered to implement individual applications based on top of AREA, this paper provides the first comprehensive overview of the entire algorithm framework. Moreover, a recently realized algorithm and new features will be presented. To demonstrate the applicability of the kernel, its features are applied in the context of various mobile applications. As the major lesson learned, powerful mobile augmented reality applications can be efficiently run on present mobile operating systems and be effectively realized by engineers using AREA. We consider such mobile frameworks as being crucial to provide more generic concepts that are able to abstract from the peculiarities of the underlying mobile operating system and to support mobile application developers more properly.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2019.08.029;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050919309433;;;Mobile Augmented Reality, Location-based Algorithms, Mobile Application Engineering, Mobile Augmented Reality Algorithms;;1877-0509;;The 16th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC 2019),The 14th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC-2019),The 9th International Conference on Sustainable Energy Information Technology;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;A meta-analysis approach to measure the impact of project-based learning outcome with program attainment on student learning using fuzzy inference systems;Mukta Goyal and Chetna Gupta and Varun Gupta;Heliyon;2022;Science@Direct;e10248;8;This paper presents a fuzzy inference method to investigate the impact of project-based assessment on the desirable outcomes by analyzing students creative and critical thinking, collaborative decision-making, and communication skills with realistic constraints and standards through theory and practical implementation in (a) course attainment and (b) on overall program attainment carried out in engineering discipline. This paper uses twelve specific parameters to capture program attainment parameters (PAPs). It proposes three main parameters to define various assessment system elements required for assessing course attainment parameters (CAPs), correlated with each other. To the best of the author's knowledge, to date, there is no defined mathematical tool to map CAPs to PAPs. Thus, this paper proposes assessment pedagogy to evaluate the PAPs corresponding to CAPs to handle the vague correlation mapping using fuzzy logic. The methodology and the preliminary results conducted for one year are promising, helping educators evaluate a candidate's performance individually or in a group on several assessment criteria, assisting in attaining the knowledge, values, attitude, deep learning, and skills needed for sustainable education development.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10248;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844022015365;;;Project-based learning, Bloom taxonomy, Course attainment parameters, Program attainment parameters, Fuzzy logic, Outcome based education, Assessment for learning;;2405-8440;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Karttunen;Education for Chemical Engineers;2023;Science@Direct;191-199;44;This paper describes a practical case study on the benefits and feasibility of a virtual laboratory as a part of chemistry laboratory exercises. Three different objectives that must fit together to create an efficient Virtual Reality (VR) learning experience were found: relevant information content, learning design, and technical feasibility. To achieve these multidisciplinary goals, a simple framework for designing VR learning materials was created. A 360-VR version of a chemistry laboratory exercise was designed and created following this framework. Data on its effectiveness was collected on a laboratory course with over 150 first-year chemical engineering students. The students completed the same laboratory exercise both as a virtual laboratory and in a real student laboratory. In the student feedback, students clearly stated that virtual laboratories cannot replace the experience in a real laboratory, and that the virtual laboratory exercises did not directly increase student motivation. Nevertheless, students showed a very positive attitude towards virtual learning materials and suggested including even more activating materials such as quizzes and interactive videos in the learning materials. Only a few students reported any downsides related to the virtual laboratory exercise. Overall, it was shown that our design principles work in practice as the students reported several real benefits when they completed a virtual laboratory exercise before the real-life laboratory exercise. These benefits included learning the correct way that the laboratory exercise proceeds and how to perform certain tasks correctly.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ece.2023.06.004;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1749772823000295;;;Chemistry laboratory education, Virtual reality, Virtual laboratory exercise, 360 environment, student engagement;;1749-7728;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Deep reinforcement learning for the computation offloading in MIMO-based Edge Computing;Abdeladim Sadiki and Jamal Bentahar and Rachida Dssouli and Abdeslam En-Nouaary and Hadi Otrok;Ad Hoc Networks;2023;Science@Direct;103080;141;Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has recently emerged as a potential technology to serve the needs of mobile devices (MDs) in 5G and 6G cellular networks. By offloading tasks to high-performance servers installed at the edge of the wireless networks, resource-limited MDs can cope with the proliferation of the recent computationally-intensive applications. In this paper, we study the computation offloading problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based MEC system where the base stations are equipped with a large number of antennas. Our objective is to minimize the power consumption and offloading delay at the MDs under the stochastic system environment. To this end, we introduce new formulation of the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose two Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to learn the optimal offloading policy without any prior knowledge of the environment dynamics. First, a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based algorithm to solve the curse of the state space explosion is defined. Then, a more general Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based algorithm to solve the problem of discrete action space is introduced. Simulation results show that our DRL-based solutions outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, our PPO algorithm exhibits stable performance and efficient offloading results compared to the benchmarks DQN and Double DQN (DDQN) strategies.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2022.103080;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870522002529;;;Multi-access Edge Computing, Massive multiple-input multiple-output, Deep reinforcement learning, Computation offloading;;1570-8705;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Interpretable machine learning assessment;Henry Han and Yi Wu and Jiacun Wang and Ashley Han;Neurocomputing;2023;Science@Direct;126891;561;With the surge of machine learning in AI and data science, there remains an urgent need to not only compare the performance of different methods across diverse datasets but also to analyze machine learning behaviors with sensitivity using an explainable approach. In this study, we introduce a uniquely designed diagnostic index: d-index to tackle this challenge. This tool integrates classification effectiveness from multiple dimensions, delivering a transparent and comprehensive assessment that transcends the limitations of traditional evaluation methods in classification. We propose two innovative concepts: breakeven states and imbalanced points in this study. Integrated with the d-index, these concepts afford a more profound understanding of the learning behaviors across different machine learning models compared to the existing classification metrics. Significantly, the d-index excels as a powerful tool, identifying learning singularity problems (LSPs) that remain elusive to most current machine learning models and imbalanced learning techniques. Furthermore, leveraging the d-index, we unravel the mechanisms behind imbalanced point generation in binary and multiclass classification. We also put forth a novel technique: identifying a priori informative kernels to optimize support vector machine learning, ensuring outstanding d-index values with the fewest necessary support vectors. Moreover, we address a seldom-discussed state of overfitting in deep learning, where overfitting occurs despite the training and testing loss curves exhibiting favorable trends throughout the epochs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents a pioneering stride in the realm of explainable machine learning assessments and will inspire further studies in this area.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2023.126891;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231223010147;;;D-index, Interpretability, Breakeven, Imbalanced point, Learning singularity problems;;0925-2312;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Aligning Education for the Life Sciences Domain to Support Digitalization and Industry 4.0;Cagatay Catal and Bedir Tekinerdogan;Procedia Computer Science;2019;Science@Direct;99-106;158;Emerging technologies like Internet of Things, Data Science, Deep Learning, Augmented Reality, Edge Computing, and Digital Twins are bringing new opportunities, challenges, and solutions for many domains including agriculture, plant sciences, animal sciences, food sciences, and social sciences. These disruptive technologies are at the center of the fourth industrial revolution, but are we ready yet to educate and prepare new generations to help society, science, and humanity adapt them? How can we change the current curriculum to reflect these technological innovations? How can we help the new generation to develop not only left-brain skills but also right-brain skills? The Netherlands is the second largest food exporter in the world after the United States and the agricultural related exports generated €45 Billion in 2018 for the economy. R&D in Dutch companies and innovation in universities in the Netherlands play an important and active role in this context. In this paper, we provide a general framework for supporting education in the context of Industry 4.0. We adopt the case study of Wageningen University at which we were actively involved in designing and customizing academic courses related to Industry 4.0. Wageningen University, which has the highest rank in the field of Agriculture & Forestry according to influential university rankings and has a rank 59 according to Times Higher Education, is traditionally a life science university but has taken also an active strategy for aligning with the developments in IT and Artificial Intelligence.

;Emerging technologies in higher education assessment and feedback practices: A systematic literature review;Ruchi Sembey and Rashina Hoda and John Grundy;Journal of Systems and Software;2024;Science@Direct;111988;211;The use of Emerging Technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Learning Analytics (LA) and Extended Reality (XR) applications, in higher education has proliferated in recent times, as these technologies are considered to have a significant impact on the future of postsecondary teaching and learning. We wanted to find out the emerging technologies used in computing education, its evaluation and effectiveness, and limitations and gaps for future research. We carried out a Systematic Literature Review study on the use of Emerging Technologies in higher education computing education to identify the state of the art in the use of these three groups of technologies for assessment and feedback practices. After systematic search and filtering from a search pool of 3038 studies published between 2016 and 2021, we selected 38 articles for detailed meta-analysis. Our findings reveal that 71% of the reviewed studies are journal articles, 50% studies focus on learning analytics, and the majority of the studies employ quantitative approaches. The results from this systematic review suggest that XR technologies have received least attention to date in computing education (amongst the emerging technologies considered for the review) and there is a lack of frameworks for design, evaluation and use of emerging technologies in higher education. The findings of this review will be beneficial for researchers and educators to obtain an in-depth understanding of the main areas of application of emerging technologies in higher education computing education, an inventory of emerging technology tools used for assessment and feedback, effectiveness indicators, and evaluation approaches that have been used. For evidence-based guidance on future assessment and feedback practices using emerging technologies, we also present a brief research agenda, drawing attention to the need to trial more XR, focus on formative assessment and feedback practices, better understand impact of human-centric issues and take more thoughtful consideration of ethics in the use of emerging technologies in computing education.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2024.111988;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121224000311;;;Emerging technologies, Artificial intelligence, Learning analytics, Extended reality, Assessment, Feedback, Systematic literature review;;0164-1212;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

Virtual reality (VR) has become a powerful and promising tool for education, and numerous studies have investigated the application and effectiveness of VR education. However, few studies have focused on the expectations and concerns of teenagers regarding head-mounted displays (HMDs), which are used for this purpose.
Methods
In this paper, we aim to explore the current problems and necessary advancements required in VR education based on a survey of 163 senior high school students who experience VR educational content for 1h. The usability and comfort of the HMD system, the physical and psychological effects on the students, and their preferences and concerns are investigated.
Results
The results show that HMDs increase students' interest, concentration, and enthusiasm for learning. However, isolated virtual environments make students feel nervous and afraid. The immersive environment also makes them worry about VR addiction and confusing the physical world with the virtual one.

;A survey on the computation offloading approaches in mobile edge computing: A machine learning-based perspective;Ali Shakarami and Mostafa Ghobaei-Arani and Ali Shahidinejad;Computer Networks;2020;Science@Direct;107496;182;With the rapid developments in emerging mobile technologies, utilizing resource-hungry mobile applications such as media processing, online Gaming, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) play an essential role in both businesses and entertainments. To soften the burden of such complexities incurred by fast developments of such serving technologies, distributed Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been developed, aimed at bringing the computation environments near the end-users, usually in one hop, to reach predefined requirements. In the literature, offloading approaches are developed to connect the computation environments to mobile devices by transferring resource-hungry tasks to the near servers. Because of some rising problems such as inherent software and hardware heterogeneity, restrictions, dynamism, and stochastic behavior of the ecosystem, the computation offloading issues consider as the essential challenging problems in the MEC environment. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, in spite of its significance, in machine learning-based (ML-based) computation offloading mechanisms, there is not any systematic, comprehensive, and detailed survey in the MEC environment. In this paper, we provide a review on the ML-based computation offloading mechanisms in the MEC environment in the form of a classical taxonomy to identify the contemporary mechanisms on this crucial topic and to offer open issues as well. The proposed taxonomy is classified into three main fields: Reinforcement learning-based mechanisms, supervised learning-based mechanisms, and unsupervised learning-based mechanisms. Next, these classes are compared with each other based on the essential features such as performance metrics, case studies, utilized techniques, and evaluation tools, and their advantages and weaknesses are discussed, as well.

;Democratic learning: hardware/software co-design for lightweight blockchain-secured on-device machine learning;Rui Zhang and Mingcong Song and Tao Li and Zhibin Yu and Yuting Dai and Xiaoguang Liu and Gang Wang;Journal of Systems Architecture;2021;Science@Direct;102205;118;Recently, the trending 5G technology encourages extensive applications of on-device machine learning, which collects user data for model training. This requires cost-effective techniques to preserve the privacy and the security of model training within the resource-constrained environment. Traditional learning methods rely on the trust among the system for privacy and security. However, with the increase of the learning scale, maintaining every edge device’s trustworthiness could be expensive. To cost-effectively establish trust in a trustless environment, this paper proposes democratic learning (DemL), which makes the first step to explore hardware/software co-design for blockchain-secured decentralized on-device learning. By utilizing blockchain’s decentralization and tamper-proofing, our design secures AI learning in a trustless environment. To tackle the extra overhead introduced by blockchain, we propose PoMC (an algorithm and architecture co-design) as a novel blockchain consensus mechanism, which first exploits cross-domain reuse (AI learning and blockchain consensus) in AI learning architecture. Evaluation results show our DemL can protect AI learning from privacy leakage and model pollution, and demonstrated that privacy and security come with trivial hardware overhead and power consumption (2%).

Various situational and interpersonal circumstances limit the opportunities for receiving support from actual animals in the real world introducing the need for alternative approaches. To that end, advances in augmented reality (AR) technology introduce new opportunities for realizing and investigating virtual dogs as social support figures. In this paper, we report on a within-subjects 3x1 (i.e., no support, virtual human, or virtual dog) experimental design study with 33 participants. We examined the effect on performance, attitude towards the task and the support figure, and stress and anxiety measured through both subjective questionnaires and heart rate data. Our mixed-methods analysis revealed that participants significantly preferred, and more positively evaluated, the virtual dog support figure than the other conditions. Emerged themes from a qualitative analysis of our participants’ post-study interview responses are aligned with these findings as some of our participants mentioned feeling more comfortable with the virtual dog compared to the virtual human although the virtual human was deemed more interactive. We did not find significant differences between our conditions in terms of change in average heart rate; however, average heart rate significantly increased during all conditions.

In order to protect data privacy and improve data learning efficiency in knowledge sharing, we propose an asynchronous federated broad learning (FBL) framework that integrates broad learning (BL) into federated learning (FL). In FBL, we design a broad fully connected model (BFCM) as a local model for training client data. To enhance the wireless channel quality for knowledge sharing and reduce the communication and computation cost of participating clients, we construct a joint resource allocation and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) configuration optimization framework for FBL. The problem is decoupled into two convex subproblems. Aiming to improve the resource scheduling efficiency in FBL, a double Davidon–Fletcher–Powell (DDFP) algorithm is presented to solve the time slot allocation and RIS configuration problem. Based on the results of resource scheduling, we design a reward-allocation algorithm based on federated incentive learning (FIL) in FBL to compensate clients for their costs. The simulation results show that the proposed FBL framework achieves better performance than the comparison models in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and cost for knowledge sharing in the IoV.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2023.04.015;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809923002965;;;Knowledge sharing, Internet of Vehicles, Federated learning, Broad learning, Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, Resource allocation;;2095-8099;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Safety education 4.0 – A critical review and a response to the process industry 4.0 need in chemical engineering curriculum;Yutian Qian and Sreeram Vaddiraju and Faisal Khan;Safety Science;2023;Science@Direct;106069;161;Safety education has found a place in the chemical engineering curriculum. However, its complete impact is yet to be realized. A part of this delay may be attributed to the gap between the concepts traditionally taught in engineering education and the tools required for the practice of engineering in the process industry. This gulf is only exacerbated by the advent of Industry 4.0, which relies heavily on emerging technologies, such as big data, automation, and machine learning. Therefore, a fundamental aspect that educators of process safety need to readdress is the following: “How can safety knowledge and competence among engineering graduates be enhanced for them to have a sustained impact on the safe design and operation of chemical processes during industrial practice?” In this context, the present work investigates the status of safety knowledge development and transfer from education to practice. A detailed analysis of demographic and temporal evaluation of safety education in specific engineering disciplines, and the shortcomings of the current curricula in imparting safety concepts to the students, are also discussed in detail. This perspective attempts to bridge the gap between academic training and the job requirements of process safety engineers through a concept titled ‘Safety Education 4.0’. In the proposed Safety Education 4.0 methodology, academics and industry personnel collaborate in teaching students safety principles through project-based learning (PBL). The compact modular format of PBL makes it flexible to be updatable on-demand process safety education.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2023.106069;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753523000115;;;Process safety education, Process system, Safety education, Process safety;;0925-7535;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;A Study of User Privacy in Android Mobile AR Apps;Yang, Xiaoyi and Zhang, Xueling;;2022;ISI Web of Science;;;"With the development of augmented reality (AR) technology, the use of
mobile AR applications (MAR apps) is rising rapidly in various aspects
of people's everyday lives, such as games, shopping, and education. When
compared to traditional apps, AR apps typically need access to the
smartphone's camera all the time and collect and analyze significantly
more data, such as sensor data, geolocation, and biometric information.
Due to the sensitivity and volume of data collected by MAR apps, new
privacy concerns are raised. In this paper, we describe a preliminary
empirical study of Android MAR apps in terms of the sensitive data
collected by MAR apps, whether the collected data is well protected, and
whether the data practice is publicly available so that users can learn
about the data safety and make informed decisions when deciding which
apps to install. In this study, we analyzed 390 real-world MAR apps and
reported the dangerous permissions they requested, the data leaks
detected in them, and the availability of their data safety.";;10.1145/3551349.3560512;;;;;;1527-1366;;"37th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering

;Digital Twin in the IoT Context: A Survey on Technical Features, Scenarios, and Architectural Models;Minerva, Roberto and Lee, Gyu Myoung and Crespi, Noël;Proceedings of the IEEE;2020;IEEE Digital Library;1785-1824;108;Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.;;10.1109/JPROC.2020.2998530;;;;"Internet of Things;Cloning;Digital twin;Software engineering;Solid modeling;Software architecture;Manufacturing processing;Artificial intelligence (AI);business models;cyber physical systems (CPSs);digital twin (DT);Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning (ML);multiagent systems;network function virtualization;sensors;servitization;smart city;software architecture;softwarization;virtual and augmented reality";;1558-2256;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

The application of VR technology in the defence paradigm is to make trainees and officers better at using equipment, navigating a mode of transport, gaining experience of potential combat situations, medical training and more. One of the advantages of VR training in defence is that it offers the functionality to immerse users in a virtual yet safe world.Our immersive system provides an intuitive way for the users to interact with the VR or AR world by physically moving around the real world and aiming freely with tangible objects. This encourages physical interaction between the players as they compete or collaborate with other players. We present a new immersive multiplayer simulation game developed for defence training. We developed three game environments which are Combat situation, Bomb defusal, and Hostage rescue, and players can see their performance based on previously played games.;;10.1109/ComPE53109.2021.9752429;;;;"Training;Performance evaluation;Solid modeling;Visualization;Costs;Three-dimensional displays;Weapons;Augmented Reality;Virtual Reality;Simulation;Networked Multiplayer Games;Software Engineering";;;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

However, there lacks a platform to effectively integrate each essential part of surgical AR, including visualization, interaction, tracking, and medical image processing, hindering new beginners or surgeons from easily building up any comprehensive AR applications. Therefore, we introduce 3D Slicer-AR-Bridge, a novel framework taking advantage of open-source medical image processing software 3D Slicer and advanced AR developing toolkits, to enable fast generation of surgical AR applications with high performance, high extensibility, and transparent data flow. The bridge is first built upon a seamless medical data sharing interface supporting volumes, segmentations, models, and annotations, between 3D Slicer and Unity, together with corresponding visualization and interaction methods. Sensor resources from AR devices are then synchronized to the bridge during visualization using holographic remoting to enable in-situ display with high render quality. Meanwhile, all resources are highly accessible in 3D Slicer, while a general user interface is provided to operate all the elements, enabling the creation of an in-situ AR application with little coding, which we believe will greatly benefit the community and clinical research. The performance tests in our paper indicate that 3D Slicer-AR-Bridge can do data exchange efficiently. At the end of our paper, we provide two different applications built with the bridge with little modification to the codes, to exemplify how the framework can help the researchers in surgical AR.;;10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct60411.2023.00086;;;;"Bridges;Performance evaluation;Three-dimensional displays;Buildings;Surgery;Data visualization;Software;Computing methodologies;Computer graphics;Graphics systems and interfaces;Mixed / augmented reality;Soft ware and its engineering;Software creation and management;Search-based software engineering;Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization systems and tools";;2771-1110;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

The main challenges to those interested in cultivation are pest attack and disease. Pests spread the disease, and the yield is decreased. However, it is possible to control pest attacks and infections in the early attack stage to reduce pesticide use and keep the farm safe. Mobile applications can provide accurate identification rather than manual detection. Mobile applications and technologies are created when considering the solution. The importance of the proposed solution is to increase the rate of the plant product and achieve high revenue without any cost. One of the main components used in this system is the image processing technique. The pest images will be taken, and they will be subjected to various preprocessing for noise reduction and enhancement of the pictures. Using image processing, the user can determine the pest's life cycle stage. The user can identify the stage of the damaged plant by applying the classification algorithm. The content analysis is based on the machine learning process, especially using a Convolutional Neural Network. Hence, the proposed system will help to get knowledge of organic pest prevention methods. In the system, we determined the type of pest with 90% accuracy by submitting a damaged leaf and a pest image. The pest's lifecycle stage and stage of the affected plant also can be identified in our system with high accuracy.

A series of procedures and methods applied in the literature review process extracting information from dataset contained articles and journals in the 2015-2021 period. A physical or traditional museum must be transformed into a smart digital museum that can carry out an educational role even during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has made limitations to museum visits that impacted fewer activities and community visits for education in the museum. Museum performance for education is not optimal during a pandemic, especially in Palembang. The results of this study indicate a trend of digital smart transformation from physical or traditional museums. Applications based on mobile devices and websites are mostly developed 72.72% of applications for education in museums. Modern museums have begun to transform into digital museums implementing intelligent machine learning based systems in the last three years and with learning application content in the form of games, augmented reality or virtual reality, and information retrieval systems.

;The Role of Technology to Teaching and Learning Sign Languages: A Systematic Mapping;Falvo, Venilton and Scatalon, Lilian Passos and Francine Barbosa, Ellen;;2020;IEEE Digital Library;1-9;;"Context: The teaching and learning process has become essential for the evolution of the society as a whole. However, there are still major challenges for achieving the global goals of education, especially if we consider the portion of the population with some type of physical disability. In this context, according to World Federation of the Deaf (WFD), deaf children face many difficulties in education due to inappropriate learning environments. Also, this problem is compounded by the lack of consistency worldwide in the provision of sign language interpreting and translation. Motivation: However, the advent of technology is having a significant impact on the way that sign language interpreters and translators work. In this sense, the union between Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and modern pedagogical practices can be the genesis for the creation of a global learning environment based on sign languages. Objective: In this scenario, this work aims to: (i) obtain an overview of the areas of Software Engineering and their technological solutions in the fields of teaching and learning sign languages; (ii) identify the main educational topics; and (iii) the most investigated sign languages. Method: Therefore, we conduct a Systematic Mapping (SM) with a focus on technologies applied in the teaching and learning of sign languages. Results: We selected 139 primary studies, using a search approach that includes both manual and automated searches, in addition to providing quality criteria for evaluating results. Thereby, we obtained pertinent information about the implemented solutions, in addition to the educational topics and sign languages covered. Conclusions: We conclude that technologies have already contributed to the teaching and learning of sign languages. In this context, different approaches were found, from solutions on traditional platforms (Web, Mobile and Desktop) to the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in smart glasses. However, no solution aims to enable communication between different sign languages, which shows a limitation that can motivate even more innovative research.";;10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274169;;;;"Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Education;Manuals;Systematics;Statistics;Software engineering;Systematic mapping;software engineering;education;sign languages";;2377-634X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;An enhanced consortium blockchain diversity mining technique for IoT metadata aggregation;Premkumar Chithaluru and Fadi Al-Turjman and Raman Dugyala and Thompson Stephan and Manoj Kumar and Jagjit Singh Dhatterwal;Future Generation Computer Systems;2024;Science@Direct;239-253;152;Over the last two decades, Internet of Things (IoT) networks have grown exponentially. Although the devices have relatively low memory, resource, and processing capability, the trend is that nodes generate a large volume of data. That is where cloud technology comes into play to provide storage space. Because of its centralized nature and robustness, a large network operating with cloud assistance may be vulnerable. Due to rigid access control policies, the devices may be vulnerable to malicious activity. On the other hand, cloud technology provides a platform for such a security system to operate. A centralized secure architecture fails to consider mobile and edge devices within the context of these criteria. This raises numerous concerns about trusting third-party cloud intermediaries, which cause security and privacy leaks. The goal of this research is to look into the problem of blockchain consensus algorithms and their applicability in IoT with cloud-native infrastructure in the Ethereum and MultiChain variants. The significant challenge is scaling the core layer without sacrificing decentralization, security, or public verifiability. This type of testbed is used to investigate the impact of architectural design and consensus models in a lightweight IoT environment. Consensus in each IoT transaction remains the most important aspect of blockchain-enabled IoT networks. When the ledger is updated without privacy protection, transaction-oriented breaches can occur. Current practices for integrating finite IoT network resources into infrastructure-oriented blockchain implementations are flawed due to they are willing to sacrifice data security and integrity in order to save time and energy. This encourages researchers to investigate an improved lightweight block verification approach to the blockchain functional framework, that decreases processing needs, network latency, and network overhead substantially. As a result, the layer-3 consensus promotes blockchain to include the block with a 35% improvement in base layer block time efficiency and a 56% increase in throughput.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2023.10.020;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X23003941;;;IoT, MultiChain, Cloud, Throughput, Security, Consensus, Latency;;0167-739X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Evaluation of 5G techniques affecting the deployment of smart hospital infrastructure: Understanding 5G, AI and IoT role in smart hospital;Arun Kumar and Aziz Nanthaamornphong and R. Selvi and J. Venkatesh and Mohammed H. Alsharif and Peerapong Uthansakul and Monthippa Uthansakul;Alexandria Engineering Journal;2023;Science@Direct;335-354;83;Smart Hospital will play a key role in improving the quality of services (QoS) related to the health sector. In the present scenario, it is impossible to accommodate an ageing population with the current infrastructure and facilities provided by conventional hospitals. However, the integration of technologies with the conventional hospital is enhancing the medical services and also making it easier for the public, who can save time and money by getting all the necessary medical facilities while sitting at home. The deployment of the fifth generation (5G) is taking place all over the world. The 5G network offers a better service that can be used in hospitals to make it a smart health service provider with online facilities such as video monitoring, suggesting a proper medical prescription based on medical data, remote surgery, and so on. High bandwidth, a fast data rate, low latency, and a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) are some requirements that need to be fulfilled by the 5G radio. In this work, we focus on improving the power savings, spectral access, latency, and Bit error rate (BER) of the advanced 5G waveforms such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In the first part of the article, we proposed a PAPR reduction algorithm to improve the power efficiency of the power amplifier (PA) for 5G waveforms. Several algorithms are applied to the 5G waveforms, and their performances are estimated in terms of PAPR curves. In the second part, we have utilised advanced detection algorithms to improve the signal detection of the 5G waveforms. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithms efficiently enhance the throughput of the framework. In the third part, we improve the spectral efficiency of the 5G waveforms by applying spectrum sensing (SS) algorithms. It is seen that the SS methods efficiently reduce the spectrum leakage of the multi-carrier waveforms (MCW). Finally, we examined the role and challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in smart hospitals. Overall, it is concluded that hospitals can become more effective, cut expenses, and provide better patient care with the aid of AI and IoT. Hospitals can improve patient outcomes and the state of the healthcare system as a whole by utilising these technologies.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2023.10.065;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016823009766;;;Smart hospital, Fifth Generation (5G), Latency, Spectral efficiency, AI, IoT;;1110-0168;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Datasets are not enough: Challenges in labeling network traffic;Jorge Luis Guerra and Carlos Catania and Eduardo Veas;Computers & Security;2022;Science@Direct;102810;120;In contrast to previous surveys, the present work is not focused on reviewing the datasets used in the network security field. The fact is that many of the available public labeled datasets represent the network behavior just for a particular time period. Given the rate of change in malicious behavior and the serious challenge to label, and maintain these datasets, they become quickly obsolete. Therefore, this work is focused on the analysis of current labeling methodologies applied to network-based data. In the field of network security, the process of labeling a representative network traffic dataset is particularly challenging and costly since very specialized knowledge is required to classify network traces. Consequently, most of the current traffic labeling methods are based on the automatic generation of synthetic network traces, which hides many of the essential aspects necessary for a correct differentiation between normal and malicious behavior. Alternatively, a few other methods incorporate non-experts users in the labeling process of real traffic with the help of visual and statistical tools. However, after conducting an in-depth analysis, it seems that all current methods for labeling suffer from fundamental drawbacks regarding the quality, volume, and speed of the resulting dataset.

Different online platforms, software and applications were used by instructors to accomplish the objectives of educational curricula. However, these tools do not provide a complete view on the learners’ progress in accumulating skills and competences since there are no instruments to measure the efficiency of the remote educational process. This problem can be resolved by integrating collaborative facilities using decision-making modules in the digital space of e-learning.

;GP-NFSP: Decentralized task offloading for mobile edge computing with independent reinforcement learning;Jiaxin Hou and Meng Chen and Haijun Geng and Rongzhen Li and Jianyuan Lu;Future Generation Computer Systems;2023;Science@Direct;205-217;141;In Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), offloading tasks from mobile devices to edge servers may accelerate the processing speed and save the energy of the devices, hence improving device users’ quality of experience. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for offload decision making. RL seeks long-term cumulative benefits and is proved useful for a sequence of decisions, thus is well suited for the work. Due to privacy and security concerns, mobile devices may be unwilling to expose their local information, leading to a fully decentralized MEC environment. Independent RL (IRL) emerges as a promising solution for this scenario. However, IRL solutions are faced with the non-stationarity issue, which arises when the components are changing their policies. In this paper, we proposing adopting the Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) architecture for offload decision making. NFSP explicitly tackles the non-stationarity issue with the built-in self-play mechanism, and uses a mixed strategy consisting of deep RL and the past average strategy, which is approximated by supervised deep learning. Furthermore, we use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm as the RL component and exploit the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to deal with the partial-observability issue in fully decentralized MEC. We conduct extensive simulation experiment, the result of which shows that our method outperforms the raw IRL approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2022.11.025;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X22003867;;;Mobile edge computing, Computation offloading, Deep reinforcement learning, Neural fictitious self-play, Proximal policy optimization, Quality of experience;;0167-739X;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;
;Multi-tasking Federated Learning meets Blockchain to Foster Trust and Security in the Metaverse;Hajar Moudoud and Soumaya Cherkaoui;Ad Hoc Networks;2023;Science@Direct;103264;150;The Metaverse is a term that refers to a shared virtual space where users can interact with each other and with a virtual environment in real-time. The Metaverse has gained a lot of attention in recent years owing to the accelerated advancements in virtual and augmented realty technologies, which made it possible to create more immersive and highly interactive experiences for users. However, as users engage with the Metaverse, they generate a lot of data, which may include their location, activity, and interactions with other users. This data can be used to train multiple machine learning (ML) models to personalize content and ads, but it can also be exploited for more nefarious uses. The problem of user data collection and the sharing of sensitive and private data in the Metaverse is a challenge. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) mechanism that can avoid problems related to data sharing by having multiple devices work together to create a ML model while maintaining their local training data private. The utilization of FL in the Metaverse involves numerous contributors, thereby increasing the susceptibility to malicious activity, including attacks. To address this issue, a promising solution is the integration of blockchain technology, which can provide a trusted solution to the metaverse that allows for secure model learning. Due to frequent communication between FL and blockchain, FL needs to be adapted to the limited communication bandwidth and limited resources of the device. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based FL framework to enhance security and trustworthiness in the Metaverse. The proposed solution utilizes a multi-task FL approach that leverages blockchain sharding to enhance the system’s throughput while simultaneously reducing resource requirements. By breaking the blockchain network into smaller shards, the processing power required for each shard is reduced, leading to an increase in overall throughput. The multi-task FL approach allows for the simultaneous training of multiple ML models, reducing the time and resources required to train each model individually. We formulate the model learning problem into a blockchain sharding problem and propose a bipartite matching solution for shard creation. Furthermore, we propose a scheduling approach to distribute the bandwidth between reliable devices, hence minimizing communication across FL devices and giving devices with a reliable behavior and informative dataset priority. Numerical results demonstrated that our framework has better performance than referenced solutions on the selected indicators.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103264;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870523001841;;;Metaverse, Federated learning, Blockchain, Device scheduling, Security;;1570-8705;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The main factors that cause this are the lack of gamelan makers or craftsmen, the high price of gamelan, and foreign cultures entering Indonesia. This causes many people who do not know about gamelan and have no interest in knowing it. Therefore, a system was created to increase public interest in learning gamelan.

Innovations like distributed computing, Machine Learning (ML), blockchain, chatbots, wearables, and pattern recognition can adequately enable the collection and processing of medical data for decision-making in the healthcare era. Particularly, to assist experts in the disease diagnostic process, distributed computing is beneficial by digesting huge volumes of data swiftly and producing personalized smart suggestions. On the other side, the current globe is confronting an outbreak of COVID-19, so an early diagnosis technique is crucial to lowering the fatality rate. ML systems are beneficial in aiding radiologists in examining the incredible amount of medical images. Nevertheless, they demand a huge quantity of training data that must be unified for processing. Hence, developing Deep Learning (DL) confronts multiple issues, such as conventional data collection, quality assurance, knowledge exchange, privacy preservation, administrative laws, and ethical considerations. In this research, we intend to convey an inclusive analysis of the most recent studies in distributed computing platform applications based on five categorized platforms, including cloud computing, edge, fog, IoT, and hybrid platforms. So, we evaluated 27 articles regarding the usage of the proposed framework, deployed methods, and applications, noting the advantages, drawbacks, and the applied dataset and screening the security mechanism and the presence of the Transfer Learning (TL) method. As a result, it was proved that most recent research (about 43%) used the IoT platform as the environment for the proposed architecture, and most of the studies (about 46%) were done in 2021. In addition, the most popular utilized DL algorithm was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a percentage of 19.4%. Hence, despite how technology changes, delivering appropriate therapy for patients is the primary aim of healthcare-associated departments. Therefore, further studies are recommended to develop more functional architectures based on DL and distributed environments and better evaluate the present healthcare data analysis models.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107745;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016926072300411X;;;Medical data processing, Healthcare data analysis, Deep learning, Distributed computing;;0169-2607;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

This change in the potentials, challenges and requirements of industrial companies is accompanied by a shift in the competencies required for the future workforce which, in turn, demands specific training. In the recent years, an increasing number of learning factories address the topic of digitalization. Nevertheless, the content of already existing training sessions mainly involves demonstrations of technologies rather than encouraging participants to develop their own creative solutions and implement them. For this reason, a digitalization training program has been developed in the LEAD Factory of the Institute of Innovation and Industrial Management at Graz University of Technology. This training program includes a case study and consists of alternating and complementary theoretical and practical training sessions. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current research concerning competencies that will be required from the future workforce, introduce the case study method as a part of digitalization training programs for learning factories and discuss whether a case study is a reliable complementary tool for the use of training programs in learning factories.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2019.03.027;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978919303919;;;digitalization, training, learning factory, case study method;;2351-9789;;Research.

;The AREA Algorithm Framework Enabling Location-based Mobile Augmented Reality Applications;Marc Schickler and Manfred Reichert and Philip Geiger and Micha Weilbach and Rüdiger Pryss;Procedia Computer Science;2019;Science@Direct;193-200;155;The dramatically increased computational capabilities of mobile devices have leveraged the opportunities for mobile application engineers. Respective scenarios, in which these opportunities can be exploited, emerge almost per day. In this context, mobile augmented reality applications play an important role in many business scenarios. In the automotive domain, they are mainly used to provide car customers with new experiences. For example, customers can use their own mobile device to experience the interior of a car by moving the mobile device around. The device’s camera then detects interior parts and shows additional information to the customer within the camera view. Although the computational capabilities have been increased, the realization of such mobile augmented reality applications is still a complex endeavor. In particular, the different mobile operating systems and their peculiarities must be carefully considered. In the AREA (Augmented Reality Engine Application) project, a powerful kernel was realized that enables location-based mobile augmented reality applications. This kernel, in turn, mainly focuses on robustness and performance. In addition, it provides a flexible architecture that fosters the development of individual location-based mobile augmented reality applications. As many aspects have to be considered to implement individual applications based on top of AREA, this paper provides the first comprehensive overview of the entire algorithm framework. Moreover, a recently realized algorithm and new features will be presented. To demonstrate the applicability of the kernel, its features are applied in the context of various mobile applications. As the major lesson learned, powerful mobile augmented reality applications can be efficiently run on present mobile operating systems and be effectively realized by engineers using AREA. We consider such mobile frameworks as being crucial to provide more generic concepts that are able to abstract from the peculiarities of the underlying mobile operating system and to support mobile application developers more properly.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2019.08.029;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050919309433;;;Mobile Augmented Reality, Location-based Algorithms, Mobile Application Engineering, Mobile Augmented Reality Algorithms;;1877-0509;;The 16th International Conference on Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC 2019),The 14th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC-2019),The 9th International Conference on Sustainable Energy Information Technology;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The global pandemic and the immediate switch to remote instruction forced instructors to reconsider how they can use computation to teach concepts previously approached with other instructional methods. In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems.

Integrated NG-IoT network, AR can improve efficiency in many fields such as mobile computing, smart city, intelligent transportation and telemedicine. However, limited by capability of mobile device, the reliability and latency requirements of AR applications is difficult to meet by local processing. To solve this problem, we study a binary offloading scheme for AR edge computing. Based on the proposed model, the parts of AR computing can offload to edge network servers, which is extend the computing capability of mobile AR devices. Moreover, a deep reinforcement learning offloading model is considered to acquire B5G network resource allocation and optimally AR offloading decisions. First, this offloading model does not need to solve combinatorial optimization, which is greatly reduced the computational complexity. Then the wireless channel gains and binary offloading states is modeled as a Markov decision process, and solved by deep reinforcement learning.

;TransCNNLoc: End-to-end pixel-level learning for 2D-to-3D pose estimation in dynamic indoor scenes;Shengjun Tang and Yusong Li and Jiawei Wan and You Li and Baoding Zhou and Renzhong Guo and Weixi Wang and Yuhong Feng;ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing;2024;Science@Direct;218-230;207;Accurate localization in GPS-denied environments has always been a core issue in computer vision and robotics research. In indoor environments, vision-based localization methods are susceptible to changes in lighting conditions, viewing angles, and environmental factors, resulting in localization failures or limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose the TransCNNLoc framework, which consists of an encoding–decoding network designed to learn more robust image features for camera pose estimation. In the image feature encoding stage, CNN and Swin Transformer are integrated to construct the image feature encoding module, enabling the network to fully extract global context and local features from images. In the decoding stage, multi-level image features are decoded through cross-layer connections while computing per-pixel feature weight maps. To enhance the framework’s robustness to dynamic objects, a dynamic object recognition network is introduced to optimize the feature weights. Finally, a multi-level iterative optimization from coarse to fine levels is performed to recover six degrees of freedom camera pose. Experiments were conducted on the publicly available 7scenes dataset as well as a dataset collected under changing lighting conditions and dynamic scenes for accuracy validation and analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TransCNNLoc framework exhibits superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and lighting changes. In the context of static environments within publicly available datasets, the localization technique introduced in this study attains a maximal precision of up to 5 centimeters, consistently achieving superior outcomes across a majority of the scenarios. Under the conditions of dynamic scenes and fluctuating illumination, this approach demonstrates an enhanced precision capability, reaching up to 3 centimeters. This represents a substantial refinement from the decimeter scale to a centimeter scale in precision, marking a significant advancement over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.

University Grenoble Alpes covers foundational courseware in computer
science (programming, complexity, database, networks, interactive
systems) during the first year and more advanced engineering courses (in
terms of cloud computing, large-scale data management, architecture,
program testing and verification) during the second year. This paper
focuses on two HCI courses as part of this curriculum in software
engineering, and describes the content and the pedagogical approach we
implemented for teaching HCI to computer science students. The paper
explains why the authors adopt a tool-based approach for the first-year
course on engineering HCI and a project-based approach with experimental
evaluation for the second-year course on advanced interaction including
multimodality.";;10.1007/978-3-030-98388-8\_24;;;;;;0302-9743;;18th IFIP TC 13 International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction(INTERACT), Bari, ITALY, AUG 30-SEP 03, 2021;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Joint Computation Partitioning and Resource Allocation for Latency Sensitive Applications in Mobile Edge Clouds;Yang, Lei and Liu, Bo and Cao, Jiannong and Sahni, Yuvraj and Wang, Zhenyu;IEEE Transactions on Services Computing;2021;IEEE Digital Library;1439-1452;14;The proliferation of mobile devices and ubiquitous access of the wireless network enable many new mobile applications such as augmented reality, mobile gaming and so on. As the applications are latency sensitive, researchers propose to offload the complex computations of these applications to the nearby edge cloud, in order to reduce the latency. Existing works mostly consider the problem of partitioning the computations between the mobile device and the traditional cloud that has abundant resources. The proposed approaches can not be applied in the context of mobile edge cloud, because both the resources in the mobile edge cloud and the wireless access bandwidth to the edge cloud are constrained. In this paper, we study joint computation partitioning and resource allocation problem for latency sensitive applications in mobile edge clouds. The problem is novel in that we combine the computation partitioning and the two-dimensional resource allocations in both the computation resources and the network bandwidth. We develop a new and efficient method, namely Multi-Dimensional Search and Adjust (MDSA), which is an offline algorithm, to solve the problem. We compare MDSA with the classic list scheduling method and the SearchAdjust algorithm via comprehensive simulations. The results show that MDSA outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of the overall application latency. Moreover, we also design an online method, named by Cooperative Online Scheduling (COS), which can be easily deployed in practical systems. By extensive evaluations, we show that COS outperforms the benchmark methods by 25 percent on average.;;10.1109/TSC.2018.2890603;;;;"Cloud computing;Bandwidth;Resource management;Mobile handsets;Computational modeling;Servers;Benchmark testing;Computation partitioning;latency sensitive applications;mobile edge clouds";;1939-1374;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A Systematic Literature Review on Service Composition for People with Disabilities: Taxonomies, Solutions, and Open Research Challenges;Namoun, Abdallah and Tufail, Ali and Nawaz, Waqas and BenRhouma, Oussama and Alshanqiti, Abdullah and Khan, Asif Irshad;Intell. Neuroscience;2023;ACM Digital Library;;2023;Integrating smart heterogeneous objects, IoT devices, data sources, and software services to produce new business processes and functionalities continues to attract considerable attention from the research community due to its unraveled advantages, including reusability, adaptation, distribution, and pervasiveness. However, the exploitation of service-oriented computing technologies (e.g., SOC, SOA, and microservice architectures) by people with special needs is underexplored and often overlooked. Furthermore, the existing challenges in this area are yet to be identified clearly. This research study presents a rigorous literature survey of the recent advances in service-oriented composition approaches and solutions for disabled people, their domains of application, and the major challenges, covering studies published between January 2010 and October 2022. To this end, we applied the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to retrieve and collate only the articles presenting and discussing service composition solutions tailored to produce digitally accessible services for consumption by people who suffer from an impairment or loss of some physical or mental functions. We searched six renowned bibliographic databases, particularly IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Springer Link, ACM Library, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, to synthesize a final pool of 38 related articles. Our survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy of service composition solutions, techniques, and practices that are utilized to create assistive technologies and services. The seven-facet taxonomy helps researchers and practitioners to quickly understand and analyze the fundamental conceptualizations and characteristics of accessible service composition for people with disabilities. Key findings showed that services are fused to assist disabled persons to carry out their daily activities, mainly in smart homes and ambient intelligent environments. Despite the emergence of immersive technologies (e.g., wearable computing), user-service interactions are enabled primarily through tactile and speech modalities. Service descriptions mainly incorporate functional features (e.g., performance, latency, and cost) of service quality, largely ignoring accessibility features. Moreover, the outstanding research problems revolve around (1) the unavailability of assistive services datasets, (2) the underspecification of accessibility aspects of disabilities, (3) the weak adoption of accessible and universal design practices, (4) the abstraction of service composition approaches, and (5) the rare experimental testing of composition approaches with disabled users. We conclude our survey with a set of guidelines to realize effective assistive service composition in IoT and cloud environments. Researchers and practitioners are advised to create assistive services that support the social relationships of disabled users and model their accessibility needs as part of the quality of service (QoS).

Comput.-Hum. Interact.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;31;Understanding how professionals use digital fabrication in production workflows is critical for future research in digital fabrication technologies. We interviewed thirteen professionals who use digital fabrication for the low-volume manufacturing of commercial products. From these interviews, we describe the workflows used for nine products created with a variety of materials and manufacturing methods. We show how digital fabrication professionals use software development to support physical production, how they rely on multiple partial representations in development, how they develop manufacturing processes, and how machine control is its own design space. We build from these findings to argue that future digital fabrication systems should support the exploration of material and machine behavior alongside geometry, that simulation is insufficient for understanding the design space, and that material constraints and resource management are meaningful design dimensions to support. By observing how professionals learn, we suggest ways digital fabrication systems can scaffold the mastery of new fabrication techniques.;;10.1145/3609328;https://doi.org/10.1145/3609328;;;Digital fabrication, low-volume production, digital design, CAD/CAM, digital craft, product design;Association for Computing Machinery;1073-0516;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Many of these activities include the robot teleoperation, i.e. controlling its movements remotely. Virtual Reality (VR) demonstrated its effectiveness in lowering the skill barrier for such a task. This paper discusses the engineering and implementation of a general-purpose, open-source framework for teleoperating a humanoid robot through a VR headset. It includes a VR interface for articulating different robot actions using the VR controllers, without the need for training. Besides, it exploits the Robot Operating System (ROS) for the control and synchronization of the robot hardware, the distribution of the computation and its scalability. The framework supports the extension for operating other types of robots and using different VR configurations. We carried out a user experience evaluation with twenty users using System Usability Scale questionnaires and with six stakeholders on five different scenarios using the Software Architecture Analysis Method.;;10.1007/s11042-022-12021-z;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12021-z;;;Humanoids robot, ROS framework, Virtual reality, Human-robot interaction, NAO robot, Unity engine;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Coordination of Autonomous Vehicles: Taxonomy and Survey;Mariani, Stefano and Cabri, Giacomo and Zambonelli, Franco;ACM Comput. Surv.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;54;In the near future, our streets will be populated by myriads of autonomous self-driving vehicles to serve our diverse mobility needs. This will raise the need to coordinate their movements in order to properly handle both access to shared resources (e.g., intersections and parking slots) and the execution of mobility tasks (e.g., platooning and ramp merging). The aim of this article is to provide a global view of the coordination issues and the related solutions in the field of autonomous vehicles. To this end, we firstly introduce the general problems associated with coordination of autonomous vehicles by identifying and framing the key classes of coordination problems. Then, we overview the different approaches that can be adopted to deal with such problems by classifying them in terms of the degree of autonomy in decision making that is left to autonomous vehicles during the coordination process. Finally, we overview some further research challenges to address before autonomous coordinated vehicles can safely hit our streets.;;10.1145/3431231;https://doi.org/10.1145/3431231;;;Autonomous vehicles, autonomy, cooperative driving, coordination, survey;Association for Computing Machinery;0360-0300;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A jointly non-cooperative game-based offloading and dynamic service migration approach in mobile edge computing;Li, Chunlin and Zhang, Qingzhe and Luo, Youlong;Knowl. Inf. Syst.;2023;ACM Digital Library;2187–2223;65;With the increase in the use of compute-intensive applications, the demand to continuously boost the efficiency of data processing increases. Offloading the compute-intensive application tasks to the edge servers can effectively solve problems for resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the computation offloading may increase network load and transmission delay, which will influence the user experience. On the other hand, the unceasing distance change between the local device and edge server could also affect the service quality due to user mobility. This paper proposes the offloading and service migration methods for compute-intensive applications to deal with these issues. First, the fine-grained computation offloading algorithm based on a non-cooperative game is proposed. The overhead on both the local side and edge side is analyzed. Moreover, the service migration path selection based on the Markov decision process is proposed by considering user mobility, energy cost, migration cost, available storage, and bandwidth. The optimal service migration path is selected according to the Markov decision process, which can improve service quality. Experiment results show that our proposed offloading strategy performs better in reducing energy consumption by more than 10% and latency by more than 6.2%, compared with other baseline algorithms, and saving mobile device energy and reducing task response time, saving over 10% of time and energy consumption compared to similar algorithms. The proposed service migration scheme can reduce migration times and maintain a success rate of more than 90% while guaranteeing service continuity in a multi-user scenario.;;10.1007/s10115-022-01822-1;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-022-01822-1;;;Mobile edge computing, Compute-intensive applications, User mobility, Computation offloading, Service migration;Springer-Verlag;0219-1377;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Online Approximation Scheme for Scheduling Heterogeneous Utility Jobs in Edge Computing;Zhang, Chi and Tan, Haisheng and Huang, Haoqiang and Han, Zhenhua and Jiang, Shaofeng H.-C. and Li, Guopeng and Li, Xiang-Yang;IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw.;2022;ACM Digital Library;352–365;31;"Edge computing systems typically handle a wide variety of applications that exhibit diverse degrees of sensitivity to job latency. Therefore, a multitude of utility functions of the job response time need to be considered by the underlying job dispatching and scheduling mechanism. Nonetheless, previous studies in edge computing mainly focused on optimizing a single utility function across all jobs, e.g., linear, sigmoid, or the hard deadline. In this paper, we design online job dispatching and scheduling strategies in which different jobs can be categorized by different non-increasing utility functions. Our goal is to maximize the total utility of all scheduled jobs. We first prove that no online deterministic algorithm could achieve a competitive ratio better than the lower bound &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=""LaTeX""&gt;$Omega left({frac {1}{sqrt {epsilon }}}right)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; under the &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=""LaTeX""&gt;$(1+epsilon)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;-speed augmentation model. We proceed to propose an online algorithm, named as &lt;monospace&gt;O4A&lt;/monospace&gt;, for handling jobs with heterogeneous utilities. We prove that &lt;monospace&gt;O4A&lt;/monospace&gt; is &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=""LaTeX""&gt;$Oleft({frac {1}{epsilon ^{2}}}right)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;-competitive. We also design its distributed version, i.e., &lt;monospace&gt;DO4A&lt;/monospace&gt;. We implement &lt;monospace&gt;O4A&lt;/monospace&gt; and &lt;monospace&gt;DO4A&lt;/monospace&gt; on an edge computing testbed running deep learning inference jobs. With the production trace from Google Cluster, our experimental and large-scale simulation results indicate that &lt;monospace&gt;O4A&lt;/monospace&gt; can increase the total utility by up to 50% compared with state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the performance loss of &lt;monospace&gt;DO4A&lt;/monospace&gt; is only 2% compared with &lt;monospace&gt;O4A&lt;/monospace&gt; with a small communication overhead involved. Moreover, both of our algorithms are robust to estimation errors in job processing time and transmission delay.";;10.1109/TNET.2022.3193381;https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2022.3193381;;;;IEEE Press;1063-6692;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;The 4IR-Health Service Delivery Nexus: Can AI Address Challenges Facing South Africa's Healthcare Services That Affect Domestic Politics?;Niyitunga, Eric Blanco;Int. J. Public Adm. Digit. Age;2023;ACM Digital Library;1–17;10;The delivery of quality healthcare services to citizens is not only a constitutional right, but also the task and obligation of every government. However, bribery, lack of financial accountability and counterfeit drugs, a shortage of human resources, poor hygiene and ineffective infection control measures, and poor medical record keeping have been identified as major challenges for the implementation of a successful public healthcare system. Fraudulent orders, tender irregularities, fiscal dumping, and over-pricing have also been identified as additional challenges. Due to the lack of quality healthcare services, people have lost trust and hope in the African National Congress (ANC). The paper found that to deliver adequate healthcare services, government needs to establish mechanisms that promote efficiency, quality, transparency, and safety. AI is a mechanism that can increase transparency, efficiency, and detect diseases before they become critical. The paper adopted a qualitative research methodology with an exploratory approach.;;10.4018/IJPADA.325215;https://doi.org/10.4018/IJPADA.325215;;;Artificial Intelligence (AI), Domestic Politics and South Africa, Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), Health Services Delivery, Healthcare System;IGI Global;2334-4520;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

An automatically segmented garment of an individual is matched to a new source garment and rendered, resulting in augmented images in which the target garment has been retextured using the texture of the source garment. We divide the problem into garment boundary matching based on Gaussian mixture models and then interpolate inner points using surface topology extracted through geodesic paths, which leads to a more realistic result than standard approaches. We evaluated and compared our system quantitatively by root mean square error (RMS) and qualitatively using the mean opinion score (MOS), showing the benefits of the proposed methodology on our gathered dataset.;;10.1007/s11042-019-7739-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-019-7739-5;;;Shape matching, Geodesic distance, Texture mapping, RGBD image processing, Gaussian mixture model;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Energy Efficient Assignment and Deployment of Tasks in Structurally Variable Infrastructures;Ca\~{n}ete, Angel;;2019;ACM Digital Library;222–229;;The importance of cyber-physical systems is growing very fast, being part of the Internet of Things vision. These devices generate data that could collapse the network and can not be assumed by the cloud. New technologies like Mobile Cloud Computing and Mobile Edge Computing are taking importance as solution for this issue. The idea is offloading some tasks to devices situated closer to the user device, reducing network congestion and improving applications performance (e.g., in terms of latency and energy). However, the variability of the target devices' features and processing tasks' requirements is very diverse, being difficult to decide which device is more adequate to deploy and run such processing tasks. Once decided, task offloading used to be done manually. Then, it is necessary a method to automatize the task assignation and deployment process. In this thesis we propose to model the structural variability of the deployment infrastructure and applications using feature models, on the basis of a SPL engineering process. Combining SPL methodology with Edge Computing, the deployment of applications is addressed as the derivation of a product. The data of the valid configurations is used by a task assignment framework, which determines the optimal tasks offloading solution in different network devices, and the resources of them that should be assigned to each task/user. Our solution provides the most energy and latency efficient deployment solution, accomplishing the QoS requirements of the application in the process.;;10.1145/3307630.3342704;https://doi.org/10.1145/3307630.3342704;;;energy efficiency, latency, mobile cloud computing, mobile edge computing, optimisation, software product line;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Games With Training Purpose for Hazard Situations in the Industry - Systematic Mapping of the Literature;Rufino J\'{u}nior, Roberto and Classe, Tadeu Moreira de and Siqueira, Sean Wolfgand Matsui;;2023;ACM Digital Library;181–188;;Context: The amount of work injuries is a world concern, both for human and financial loss. Organizations could have avoided most accidents if they decreased human failure by using more effective training methods. Several studies point to games as information systems (IS) capable of doing training for hazard situations more engaging and efficient, being an attractive innovation for the industry. Problem: Nevertheless, understanding, designing, and implementing these games are challenging because they must combine training characteristics and games ludicid without passing wrong information to the workers. Solution: In this paper, we explored studies that could support understanding how games with training purposes have been used for training dangerous situations in the industry. Method: We described and performed a Systematic Mapping of Literature (SML) for that. Summary Results: In the search step, we found 153 studies, but after the evaluation criteria, we considered only 15 relevant to this research. The results pointed to a concentration of games to immerse workers in the job environment, using elements such as narratives, puzzles, rewards, and feedback. The cost of implementation, highlighted by managers as essential for adopting games for risk training, was not approached in any study. Contributions to IS: Therefore, this study contributes to the IS field by identifying features of designing games as IS for training risk situations in the industry. In addition, these immersive environments could save lives and decrease spending on industrial accidents.;;10.1145/3592813.3592904;https://doi.org/10.1145/3592813.3592904;;;Games With Purpose, Hazard, Industry., Systematic Mapping, Training;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A context-aware recommendation system for improving manufacturing process modeling;Wang, Jiaxing and Gao, Sibin and Tang, Zhejun and Tan, Dapeng and Cao, Bin and Fan, Jing;J. Intell. Manuf.;2021;ACM Digital Library;1347–1368;34;Process recommendation is an essential technique to help process modeler effectively and efficiently model a manufacturing process from scratch. However, the current process recommendation methods suffer from the following problems: (1) To extract all the execution paths from a manufacturing process, the behavior-based methods may occur a state space explosion problem when unfolding a process with multiple parallel patterns, resulting in low efficiency. (2) Current structure-based methods are inefficient since too many expensive computations of the graph edit distance are involved. (3) Most of the existing methods manually design their process similarity metrics with several features, which can only be applied in specific situations. (4) Few works provide visualization tools for process modeling assistance. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a context-aware recommendation system for improving manufacturing process modeling. First, the independent paths and P,Q-grams are efficiently extracted from the manufacturing processes in the repository to represent their typical behavior and structure. Then, the process recommendation problem is transformed into the word prediction problem in natural language processing, where the serialization of an independent path/P,Q-gram and a node in it are separately regarded as a sentence and a word. The Word2vec model is introduced to automatically learn the relationships among nodes from independent paths and P,Q-grams and generate the vectors with hundreds of context-aware features for nodes in the repository. After that, the top-k similar nodes are recommended for the target node in the process fragment under construction based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Finally, a visualization tool is provided for process modelers to efficiently design a new manufacturing process. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method can perform similar or even better than the baseline methods in terms of recommending quality.;;10.1007/s10845-021-01854-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-021-01854-4;;;Manufacturing process, Process modeling, Process recommendation, Word2vec;Springer-Verlag;0956-5515;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

We believe that technology can challenge this notion through the design of neuroresponsive systems for interpersonal communication. We explore this through ""Neo-Noumena"", a communicative neuroresponsive system that uses brain-computer interfacing and artificial intelligence to read one's emotional states and dynamically represent them to others in mixed reality through two head-mounted displays. In our study five participant pairs were given Neo-Noumena for three days, using the system freely. Measures of emotional competence demonstrated a statistically significant increase in participants' ability to interpersonally regulate emotions. Furthermore, participant interviews revealed themes regarding Spatiotemporal Actualization, Objective Representation, and Preternatural Transmission. We also suggest design strategies for future augmented emotion communication systems.

;Understanding Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Systems: A Conceptual Model;Yue, Tao and Arcaini, Paolo and Ali, Shaukat;;2020;ACM Digital Library;54–71;;Digital Twins (DTs) are revolutionizing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in many ways, including their development and operation. The significant interest of industry and academia in DTs has led to various definitions of DTs and related concepts, as seen in many recently published papers. Thus, there is a need for precisely defining different DT concepts and their relationships. To this end, we present a conceptual model that captures various DT concepts and their relationships, some of which are from the published literature, to provide a unified understanding of these concepts in the context of CPSs. The conceptual model is implemented as a set of Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams and the concepts in the conceptual model are explained with a running example of an automated warehouse case study from published literature and based on the authors’ experience of working with the real CPS case study in previous projects.;;10.1007/978-3-030-83723-5_5;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83723-5_5;;;Cyber-physical systems, Digital twins, Conceptual model;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Discovering commute patterns via process mining;Yousfi, Alaaeddine and Weske, Mathias;Knowl. Inf. Syst.;2019;ACM Digital Library;691–713;60;Ubiquitous computing has proven its relevance and efficiency in improving the user experience across a myriad of situations. It is now the ineluctable solution to keep pace with the ever-changing environments in which current systems operate. Despite the achievements of ubiquitous computing, this discipline is still overlooked in business process management. This is surprising, since many of today's challenges, in this domain, can be addressed by methods and techniques from ubiquitous computing, for instance user context and dynamic aspects of resource locations. This paper takes a first step to integrate methods and techniques from ubiquitous computing in business process management. To do so, we propose discovering commute patterns via process mining. Through our proposition, we can deduce the users' significant locations, routes, travel times and travel modes. This information can be a stepping-stone toward helping the business process management community embrace the latest achievements in ubiquitous computing, mainly in location-based service. To corroborate our claims, a user study was conducted. The significant places, routes, travel modes and commuting times of our test subjects were inferred with high accuracies. All in all, ubiquitous computing can enrich the processes with new capabilities that go beyond what has been established in business process management so far.;;10.1007/s10115-018-1255-1;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-018-1255-1;;;Commute pattern, Commute process, Location-based services, Process mining, Ubiquitous computing;Springer-Verlag;0219-1377;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Software Futures and Overall Trends;;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;;Software history has a deep impact on current software designers, computer scientists, and technologists. System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include “old” software and “historical” programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques.Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.;;;https://doi.org/10.1145/3477339.3477348;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;The Evolution of HCI and Human Factors: Integrating Human and Artificial Intelligence;Chignell, Mark and Wang, Lu and Zare, Atefeh and Li, Jamy;ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum. Interact.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;30;We review HCI history from both the perspective of its 1980s split with human factors and its nature as a discipline. We then revisit human augmentation as an alternative to user friendliness that seems particularly relevant in the areas of inclusive design and artificial intelligence. Viewing human-AI interaction as a kind of human augmentation raises issues such as how to promote trust and situation awareness. We also pose the question: Can HCI and human factors engineering work together to solve the increasingly urgent challenges of human-AI technology? In an initial look at this question, we contrast the different approaches of HCI and human factors on emerging AI research. This article concludes by considering other potentially promising paths for HCI. We propose more collaboration between HCI and human factors, or related disciplines, in the future to address the massive challenges posed by the rapid growth in data science and artificial intelligence.;;10.1145/3557891;https://doi.org/10.1145/3557891;;;Human factors, cognitive science, artificial intelligence (AI);Association for Computing Machinery;1073-0516;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Although the past decades have experienced continuous digitalization of services and products that impact business and society, conceptual modeling efforts are still required to support new technologies as they emerge. This paper surveys research on conceptual modeling over the past five decades and shows how its topics and trends continue to evolve to accommodate emerging technologies, while remaining grounded in basic constructs. We survey over 5,300 papers that address conceptual modeling topics from the 1970s to the present, which are collected from 35 multidisciplinary journals and conferences, and use them as the basis from which to analyze the progression of conceptual modeling. The important role that conceptual modeling should play in our evolving digital world is discussed, and future research directions proposed.;;10.1145/3589338;https://doi.org/10.1145/3589338;;;Conceptual modeling, digital world, database, information systems, information technology, structured literature review, clustering analysis;Association for Computing Machinery;0360-0300;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Alternate histories and conflicting futures: git version control as software development infrastructure;York, Eric J.;Commun. Des. Q. Rev;2022;ACM Digital Library;57–65;10;Despite their central importance to a variety of endeavors and despite widespread use in both industry and academia, version control systems (software for tracking versions of files) have not been extensively studied in fields related to technical communication, rhetoric, and communication design. Git, by far the most dominant version control system today, is largely absent. This study theorizes Git as boundary infrastructure---infrastructure used to facilitate collaboration across disciplines and domains. The unique characteristics of boundary infrastructure explain how something as prominent as Git can be so invisible and help identify dangers posed by boundary infrastructure. Drawing on modes of resistance developed in feminist rhetorics, this article concludes with suggestions to ameliorate the negatives effects such infrastructure might have on collaborative knowledge work.;;10.1145/3507857.3507863;https://doi.org/10.1145/3507857.3507863;;;GitHub, boundary studies, git, infrastructure, source management, version control;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Many research teams have been dedicated to algorithms and optimizations in the cloud-edge data cache and computation offloading schemes, while there is a blank in practical implementation to facilitate such a paradigm. In this work, we proposed a component-based framework that facilitates dynamic partitioning of a software program. We have designed and implemented the very first test-bed for further optimizing the components distribution strategy among cloud, edge, and terminal devices. Experiments have revealed the characteristics of components execution in the proposed architecture, showing that the system can improve computing performance under the real-world unstable network environments.;;10.1007/978-3-030-60239-0_15;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-60239-0_15;;;Cloud computing, Edge computing, Software decomposition, Offloading, Distributed system;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;How Privacy Concerns, Trust and Risk Beliefs, and Privacy Literacy Influence Users' Intentions to Use Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: The Case of Tor;Harborth, David and Pape, Sebastian;SIGMIS Database;2020;ACM Digital Library;51–69;51;Due to an increasing collection of personal data by internet companies and several data breaches, research related to privacy gained importance in the last years in the information systems domain. Privacy concerns can strongly influence users' decision to use a service. The Internet Users Information Privacy Concerns (IUIPC) construct is one operationalization to measure the impact of privacy concerns on the use of technologies. However, when applied to a privacy enhancing technology (PET) such as an anonymization service, the original rationales do not hold anymore. In particular, an inverted impact of trusting and risk beliefs on behavioral intentions can be expected. We show that the IUIPC model needs to be adapted for the case of PETs. In addition, we extend the original causal model by including trusting beliefs in the anonymization service itself as well as a measure for privacy literacy. A survey among 124 users of the anonymization service Tor shows that trust in Tor has a statistically significant effect on the actual use behavior of the PET. In addition, the results indicate that privacy literacy has a negative impact on trusting beliefs in general and a positive effect on trust in Tor.;;10.1145/3380799.3380805;https://doi.org/10.1145/3380799.3380805;;;privacy concerns, privacy literacy, privacy-enhancing technologies, technology use., tor;Association for Computing Machinery;0095-0033;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

At one extreme is offloading of compute-intensive operations to a cloudlet nearby. At the other extreme is the use of fixed-function hardware accelerators on mobile devices. Between these endpoints lie various configurations of programmable hardware accelerators. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches and conclude that they are, in fact, complementary. Based on this insight, we advocate a softwarehardware co-evolution path that combines their strengths.;;10.1145/3486880.3486882;https://doi.org/10.1145/3486880.3486882;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;2375-0529;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A cylindrical shape descriptor for registration of unstructured point clouds from real-time 3D sensors;He, Yu and Chen, Shengyong and Yu, Hongchuan and Yang, Thomas;J. Real-Time Image Process.;2021;ACM Digital Library;261–269;18;To deal with data sets from real-time 3D sensors of RGB-D or TOF cameras, this paper presents a method for registration of unstructured point clouds. We firstly derive intrinsic shape context descriptors for 3D data organization. To replace the Fast-Marching method, a vertex-oriented triangle propagation method is applied to calculate the ’angle’ and ’radius’ in descriptor charting, so that the matching accuracy at the twisting and folding area is significantly improved. Then, a 3D cylindrical shape descriptor is proposed for registration of unstructured point clouds. The chosen points are projected into the cylindrical coordinate system to construct the descriptors. The projection parameters are respectively determined by the distances from the chosen points to the reference normal vector, and the distances from the chosen points to the reference tangent plane and the projection angle. Furthermore, Fourier transform is adopted to deal with orientation ambiguity in descriptor matching. Practical experiments demonstrate a satisfactory result in point cloud registration and notable improvement on standard benchmarks.;;10.1007/s11554-020-01033-3;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11554-020-01033-3;;;Cylindrical shape descriptor, Unstructured point cloud, 3D registration, RGB-D data, Depth image;Springer-Verlag;1861-8200;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

It is a solution to materialise the IoT and helps to improve the resource allocation problem. In this paper, we propose an effective method to conquer the resource allocation problem in IoT applications. Our method defines two important objectives: 1) reducing the internet core traffic; 2) serving subscribers with the appropriate quality of service level. The experimental results, which are reported in form of numerous and various scenarios, indicate that the suggested MMGM method can reduce the internet core traffic up to 50%. Also, the minimum deviation from the required or the contracted quality level of service is realised with the help of the Most Graceful Matching (MGM) assignment method.";;10.1504/ijcnds.2020.108155;https://doi.org/10.1504/ijcnds.2020.108155;;;fog computing, internet of things, IoT, resource allocation, quality of service, QoS, traffic aware;Inderscience Publishers;1754-3916;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;QoS-Aware Optical Fog-Assisted Cyber-Physical System in the 5G Ready Heterogeneous Network;Singh, Kiran Deep and Sood, Sandeep K.;Wirel. Pers. Commun.;2021;ACM Digital Library;3331–3350;116;In recent years, the emergence of Internet of things and cyber-physical system provide a proactive and efficacious solution to enable remote monitoring, machine learning-based analytics, and quick decision making for real-time applications. Cloud supported systems still face Quality of Service issues for implementing time-sensitive applications. Introducing 5G network services by revolutionizing existing technologies can increase communication efficiency and provide optimum trade-offs for connected IoT devices. In this paper, NFV, ONV, and SDN is used to create a computational OpticalFog node in the middleware of cloud and edge that provides an ecosystem to facilitate an ultra-fast infrastructure in the 5G network. The main aim behind the proposed system is to (1) exploit the computational potential of optical resources to create an OpticalFog node to be integrated into the 5G network infrastructure for CPS-based applications, (2) present an algorithm for optimum placement that provide service assurance to various CPS-based applications, and (3) enable CPS-based applications, which are able to run on top of the OpticalFog and 5G infrastructure. Therefore, a case study based on the deployment surveillance system in an academic institute using the proposed system is presented. iFogSim toolkit is used to implement the proposed OpticalFog-based deployment for the surveillance cameras. The results show the significant advantages of the proposed system for CPS-based applications in the 5G network.;;10.1007/s11277-020-07855-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11277-020-07855-5;;;Cyber-physical system, Fog computing, Passive optical network, Camera surveillance, 5G, Quality of service;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0929-6212;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;How are software technologies being evaluated with autistic users? A systematic mapping;Marques, Anna Beatriz and da Silva Monte, Leandro;Univers. Access Inf. Soc.;2022;ACM Digital Library;587–597;21;Evaluating software technologies with users is a way to ensure the software purpose is accomplished before the system becomes available to the final users. There is a need for researches proposing and evaluating software technologies for autistic users. However, there is a difficulty to involve autistic users in interaction tasks, due to their tendency to isolation and inability to communicate their needs. We aim to explore how are software technologies being evaluated with autistic users. In this research, we carried out a systematic mapping of the literature to identify and analyze scientific publications that report software technologies evaluation with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) users. The data extraction enables us to identify evaluation methods, data collection procedures, professionals involved, test environments, and ASD aspects evaluated. We noted that user tests were conducted in clinics or classrooms with health professionals, teachers, or caregivers intermediating the autistic user interaction with software technologies to promote better engagement. Observation, questionnaires, and interviews are the most common data collection methods adopted. However, we did not identify specific instruments for evaluating ASD aspects related to software technologies. With our results, we aim to encourage the proposal of evaluation protocols for diverse kinds of software technologies such as serious games or educational software. We also expect to support researchers or professionals in selecting and adopting suitable evaluation procedures to assess software technologies with autistic users. In this way, we can obtain more evidence regarding the impact of technologies in ASD behavioral and social skills development.;;10.1007/s10209-021-00794-3;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-021-00794-3;;;Autism spectrum disorder, Software technologies, Human–computer interface, Systematic mapping study, Users evaluation;Springer-Verlag;1615-5289;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Manage.;2019;ACM Digital Library;59–77;27;This article describes how despite the extensive academic interest in e-commerce, an investigation of consumer cognitive innovativeness towards new product purchase intention has been neglected. Based on the stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) model, this study investigates the consumer cognitive innovativeness and the moderating role of the individual consumer-level uncertainty avoidance cultural value towards new product purchase intention in business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce. Structural equation modelling, such as partial least squares (PLS) path modelling was used to test the model, using a sample of 255 participants in Australia who have had prior online shopping experience. The findings show that the online store web atmosphere influences consumers' cognitive innovativeness to purchase new products in countries with diverse degrees of uncertainty avoidance such as Australia. The results provide some guidance for a B2C website design based on how individual's uncertainty avoidance and cognitive innovativeness can aid the online consumer purchasing decision-making process.;;10.4018/JGIM.2019040104;https://doi.org/10.4018/JGIM.2019040104;;;Cognitive Innovativeness, Consumer Innovativeness, Culture, E-Commerce, New Product Purchase, Social Networking Services, Uncertainty Avoidance, Web Accessibility, Web Design;IGI Global;1062-7375;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Comput.;2023;ACM Digital Library;3373–3386;39;"The interest in real-time volume graphics has grown rapidly in the last few years, driven by the increasing demands from both academia and industry. GPU-based volume rendering has been used in a wide variety of fields, including scientific visualization, visual effects, and video games. Similarly, real-time volume editing has been used to build terrain and create visual effects during game development; it has even become an integral part of gameplay in various video games (e.g., Minecraft). Nowadays, as the size of volume data increases, processing large volume data in real time is inevitable in many modern application scenarios. However, manipulation and editing of large volume data are associated with various challenges, such as dramatically increasing memory usage and computational burden. In this paper, we present a framework for interactive manipulation and editing of large volume data to address these challenges. A robust and efficient method for large signed distance function (SDF) volume generation is presented and incorporated into the framework. Also, a complete implementation with specialized GPU optimization is introduced to demonstrate its usefulness and effectiveness—it is included in the framework as well. The framework can be an easy-to-use middleware or a plugin that is able to integrate into game engines for the development of various types of applications (e.g., video games). It can also contribute to the research looking at large volume data from a user-centered perspective (e.g., for human–computer interaction researchers).";;10.1007/s00371-023-02976-x;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-023-02976-x;;;Volume graphics, Large volume data, Volume editing, Volume manipulation, Framework;Springer-Verlag;0178-2789;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

J. Mob. Comput. Multimed. Commun.;2022;ACM Digital Library;1–22;13;Because of the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, the use of mobile applications has exploded recently. However, the variety of mobile platforms compels developers to create an app for each, making the process more complex and expensive. Thus, open-source cross-platform mobile frameworks have been developed to address this problem, allowing the same code to be imported across various operating systems. This paper comes to propose a new framework for the selection of the appropriate platform for the implementation of a cross-platform mobile application. This framework is based on the most used multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, namely analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods are used. A demonstrative example is proposed to illustrate the suggested methodology.;;10.4018/IJMCMC.297928;https://doi.org/10.4018/IJMCMC.297928;;;AHP, Cross-Platform Mobile Development, Decision Framework, Multi-Criteria Decision Making, TOPSIS;IGI Global;1937-9412;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;"Upilio: Leveraging the&nbsp;Serverless Paradigm for&nbsp;Building a&nbsp;Versatile IoT Application";Mock, Markus and Arlt, Stefan;;2022;ACM Digital Library;121–136;;Serverless computing has emerged over the last couple of years as a flexible paradigm for deploying cloud-based applications and allowing developers to focus on their applications and reduce application maintenance costs over the lifetime of an application. However, there has not been an examination of whether a complex application can be built and operated with high performance and low operating cost relying entirely on the serverless paradigm. This paper presents the design, implementation, performance, and cost evaluation of what we believe to be a representative kind of IoT application, a cloud-based energy data management system named Upilio. Upilio is a versatile data collection and analysis platform for IoT sensor data. Upilio’s functionality is implemented entirely using AWS Lambda serverless functions and managed services to store data, and even the graphical user interface does not need a dedicated web server. Our empirical evaluation shows that the system, including its serverless online analytics (OLAP) functionality, is cost-effective, requiring only a fraction of the server cost necessary for operating such a system using on-premise hardware. Thus, Upilio demonstrates that complex IoT system scenarios can be implemented successfully with good performance and cost characteristics leveraging the serverless paradigm.;;10.1007/978-3-031-04718-3_8;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-04718-3_8;;;Serverless Computing, FaaS, IoT;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Towards Flexible Authoring and Personalization of Virtual Reality Applications for Training;Ketoma, Vix Kemanji and Vanderdonckt, Jean and Meixner, Gerrit;Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;7;Virtual reality applications offer the promise to immerse end users in a synthetic environment where several actions could be observed, simulated, and reproduced, before transferring them to reality, which makes them particularly appropriate for training. Yet, when the training requires complex handling of information, the tasks become cognitively intensive, and developing adequate applications becomes challenging. To address this challenge, we define a method for developing head-mounted-display-based virtual reality applications for modular training tasks, composed of a training model with parameters, a step-wise approach for supporting this development, and a software framework enacting the application of this approach. Authoring such applications is expected to become more flexible and provide personalization facilities. To evaluate the impact of this method, we define a case study concerning an application for training school teachers who deal with a variety of situations in a classroom for an experiment involving N= 7 participants for a set of tasks. Pre-study and post-study acceptances reveal the impact of the software framework and a workload evaluation is conducted using the NASA TLX questionnaire.;;10.1145/3593241;https://doi.org/10.1145/3593241;;;software development method, software framework, training, training scenario authoring, virtual reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Requirements for data-driven reliability modeling and simulation of smart manufacturing systems;Friederich, Jonas and Jepsen, Sune Chung and Lazarova-Molnar, Sanja and Worm, Torben;;2022;ACM Digital Library;;;Planning and deploying reliable Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMSs) is of increasing interest to both scholars and practitioners. High system reliability goes hand in hand with reduced maintenance costs and enables optimized repairs and replacements. To leverage the full potential of SMSs and enable data-driven reliability assessment, data needs should be precisely defined. System integration is a key concept of the Industry 4.0 initiative and it can aid the extraction of the needed data. In this paper, we study the data requirements for a novel middleware for SMSs to enable and support data-driven reliability assessment. We present this middleware architecture and demonstrate its application through a case study, which is used to generate exemplary data that corresponds to the derived requirements. The data requirements and the middleware architecture can support researchers in developing novel data-driven reliability assessment methods, as well as assist practitioners in designing and deploying SMSs in companies.;;;;;;;IEEE Press;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Investigating Privacy Perceptions and Subjective Acceptance of Eye Tracking on Handheld Mobile Devices;Alsakar, Noora and Abdrabou, Yasmeen and Stumpf, Simone and Khamis, Mohamed;Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput.

Recent research demonstrates that tracking an individual's gaze reveals personal and sensitive information. This paper presents an investigation of the privacy perceptions and the subjective acceptance of users towards eye tracking on handheld mobile devices. In a four-phase user study (N=17), participants used a smartphone eye tracking app, were interviewed before and after viewing a video showing the amount of sensitive and personal data that could be derived from eye movements, and had their privacy concerns measured. Our findings 1) show factors that influence users' and bystanders' attitudes toward eye tracking on mobile devices such as the algorithms' transparency and the developers' credibility and 2) support designing mechanisms to allow for privacy-aware eye tracking solutions on mobile-devices.;;10.1145/3591133;https://doi.org/10.1145/3591133;;;eye tracking, gaze-based interaction, privacy concerns, smartphones;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Probability-Based Channel Pruning for Depthwise Separable Convolutional Networks;Zhao, Han-Li and Shi, Kai-Jie and Jin, Xiao-Gang and Xu, Ming-Liang and Huang, Hui and Lu, Wang-Long and Liu, Ying;J. Comput. Sci. Technol.;2022;ACM Digital Library;584–600;37;Channel pruning can reduce memory consumption and running time with least performance damage, and is one of the most important techniques in network compression. However, existing channel pruning methods mainly focus on the pruning of standard convolutional networks, and they rely intensively on time-consuming fine-tuning to achieve the performance improvement. To this end, we present a novel efficient probability-based channel pruning method for depth-wise separable convolutional networks. Our method leverages a new simple yet effective probability-based channel pruning criterion by taking the scaling and shifting factors of batch normalization layers into consideration. A novel shifting factor fusion technique is further developed to improve the performance of the pruned networks without requiring extra time-consuming fine-tuning. We apply the proposed method to five representative deep learning networks, namely MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV1, ShuffleNetV2, and GhostNet, to demonstrate the efficiency of our pruning method. Extensive experimental results and comparisons on publicly available CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets validate the feasibility of the proposed method.;;10.1007/s11390-022-2131-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-022-2131-8;;;network compression, channel pruning, depthwise separable convolution, batch normalization;Springer-Verlag;1000-9000;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;The Many Faces of Patterns in the Internet of Things;Sithole, Vusi and Marshall, Linda;;2020;ACM Digital Library;43–52;;In recent years, a lot of attention has been given to patterns in the Internet of Things (IoT). In essence, these patterns provide well-known ways to solve problems commonly encountered in the IoT paradigm. However, despite this recognition, conceptualising patterns in the IoT has proven to be difficult. This is mainly because IoT patterns come in many shapes, forms and sizes, and can be abstracted from many levels of the system architecture. In fact, many patterns in the IoT are system-independent and can be abstracted from other fundamental aspects that make up the IoT. This seemingly broad variations of patterns has led to some confusion regarding what constitute a pattern in the IoT. This has raised many unanswered questions in the IoT pattern community, such as (i) if patterns are not only about objects, and if they reach far beyond software architecture, then what is an IoT pattern?, and (ii) what are the solution categories in which the underlying IoT patterns can be abstracted? With these questions in mind, we set out to perform a deeper analysis of the meaning of the word pattern in the context of the IoT. We discovered that the IoT patterns give us a standardised vocabulary to talk about structures larger than objects, modules and procedures. That is, patterns are, in fact, a literature that is ingrained in problem solving and design thinking in the holistic IoT domain.;;10.1145/3429523.3429527;https://doi.org/10.1145/3429523.3429527;;;Internet of Things, Internet of Things Patterns, IoT Pattern Language, IoT Reference Architectures, IoT Vocabulary;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

However, BDAC pays off for some companies but not for others. It appears that very few have achieved a big impact through big data. To address this challenge, this study proposes a BDAC model drawing on the resource-based theory and the dynamic capability theory. In order to carry out the research, this paper takes Chinese internet enterprises as the research object and obtains survey data from 629 employees through questionnaires.

;Affective State Based Anomaly Detection in Crowd;Baliniskite, Glorija and Lavendelis, Egons and Pudane, Mara;Appl. Comput. Syst.;2019;ACM Digital Library;134–140;24;To distinguish individuals with dangerous abnormal behaviours from the crowd, human characteristics (e.g., speed and direction of motion, interaction with other people), crowd characteristics (such as flow and density), space available to individuals, etc. must be considered. The paper proposes an approach that considers individual and crowd metrics to determine anomaly. An individual’s abnormal behaviour alone cannot indicate behaviour, which can be threatening toward other individuals, as this behaviour can also be triggered by positive emotions or events. To avoid individuals whose abnormal behaviour is potentially unrelated to aggression and is not environmentally dangerous, it is suggested to use emotional state of individuals. The aim of the proposed approach is to automate video surveillance systems by enabling them to automatically detect potentially dangerous situations.;;10.2478/acss-2019-0017;https://doi.org/10.2478/acss-2019-0017;;;Anomaly detection in crowd, dangerous anomaly detection, emotional state, person extraction from crowd, surveillance system automation;Walter de Gruyter GmbH;2255-8691;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Syst.;2022;ACM Digital Library;315–344;82;Scientific and technological breakthroughs carry with themselves a pertinent question—“what’s next”. The evolution of mobile networks and spectrum technology over the last two decades has only confirmed this well-established fact. The ever-increasing need for broadening frequency bands, connectivity of devices which now run in billions of numbers, lower latency (so that we can enjoy interruption-free services 24\texttimes{}7), increasing intervention of artificial intelligence in our day-to-day life, remote connectivity, and virtual presence to increase our output and reach and many more aspects have only intensified the demand for a more reliable, robust, intelligent, secure and friendly infrastructure through which the data, touted as the new oil for 21st century can be produced, stored and transmitted efficiently. The existing 4G and 5G systems cannot handle the ever-growing latency and connectivity needs of the Internet of Everything. Therefore, in this article, we present the vision of 6G technology with its requirements and discuss the associated challenges and enabler technologies in detail. Yet, with the advent of the quantum computer, all public-key-based techniques employed to provide communication security in existing smart networks, irrespective of underlying communication technology, are prone to quantum attacks. Hence, case studies related to Internet-of-Vehicles and Internet-of-Things utilizing a newly proposed architecture based on quantum secured 6G enabled communication is discussed to realize the secure and efficient Internet of Everything.;;10.1007/s11235-022-00979-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11235-022-00979-y;;;5G, 6G, Quantum computing, Internet-of-vehicles, Internet-of-things;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1018-4864;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

To shield internet users from phishing assaults, numerous anti-phishing models have been proposed. Currently employed techniques to handle these challenges are not sufficient and capable enough. We aim at identifying phishing sites in order to guard internet users from being vulnerable to any form of phishing attacks by verifying the conceptual and literal consistency between the uniform resource locator (URL) and the web content.

Intell. Robotics Syst.;2019;ACM Digital Library;311–329;95;Development and verification of real-time algorithms for robotic total stations usually require hard-ware-in-the-loop approaches, which can be complex and time-consuming. Simulator-in-the-loop can be used instead, but the design of a simulation environment and sufficient detailed modeling of the hardware are required. Typically, device specification and calibration data are provided by the device manufacturers and are used by the device drivers. However, geometric models of robotic total stations cannot be used directly with existing ro-botic simulators. Model details are often treated as company secrets, and no source code of device drivers is available to the public. In this paper, we present a complete workflow for automatic geometric model extraction of robotic total stations using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. We provide a complete set of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for an exemplary ro-botic total station. These parameters can be used in existing robotic simulators without modifications. Furthermore, we analyze the difference between the extracted geometric model, the calibrated model, which is used by the device drivers, and the standard spherical representation for 3D point measurements of the device.;;10.1007/s10846-018-0931-4;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10846-018-0931-4;;;Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, Forward kinematics, Robot control, Robot kinematics, Robotic total station;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0921-0296;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Big Data Skills Sustainable Development in Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals;Pesqueira, Ant\'{o}nio and Sousa, Maria Jos\'{e} and Rocha, \'{A}lvaro;J. Med. Syst.;2020;ACM Digital Library;;44;Big Data technology is one of the most promising organizational processes within the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical industry and crucial for any company that wants to preserve the competitive advantage in the market, where most of the organizational structures are already struggling with the right skills and knowledge to fully support existing business needs for storing and processing and even analyzing information. This paper aims to examine the extent to which new Big Data technology and data-related processes are developing different professionals skills and competencies within the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical industries, and creating sustainable development in addressing critical organizational challenges in recruiting, retaining, and discover professional skills that can fully support the advances and exponential growth of Big Data technology benefits. This research paper also highlights the significant aspects of Big Data in professional technical and process oriented skills development, and the influence it has on organizational business processes including how various internal functions will need to adapt to new circumstances with renewed competency and skills development programs for departments that are strongly connected to the business and analytical needs. We conducted a focus group with twenty-five industry based professionals’ ranges from analysts to executive directors to better assess the necessary knowledge to answer the proposed research questions: (1) which professional skills can big data influence in employee development and (2) how can organizations adapt their employee skills to big data. Regarding the key research limitations/implications most of the article and research was built on the foundation of the literature review and the performed focus group. The conceptual recommendations and observations presented provide solid empirical evidence but should be subjected to more comprehensive, large-scale empirical testing and validation. It’s recommended for future research a more extensive sample of companies, organizations, and interviewees. Studying a broader set of similar research questions in more homogeneous organizations could provide deeper insights into the process, governance, and stakeholder dimensions of Big Data within specific contexts. Therefore this study contributes to explore in-depth and systematically to what extent Big Data technology and processes are currently influencing the healthcare and pharmaceuticals industries where to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first focus group dealing with the presented research questions.;;10.1007/s10916-020-01665-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-020-01665-9;;;Big data, Skills development, Healthcare and pharmaceutical, Professionals skills;Plenum Press;0148-5598;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A Meta-Analysis of Effect Sizes of CHI Typing Experiments;Obukhova, Natalia;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;;While designing an HCI experiment, planning the sample size with a priori power analysis is often skipped due to the lack of reference effect sizes. On the one hand, it can lead to a false-negative result, missing the effect that is present in the population. On the other hand, it poses a risk of spending more resources if the number of participants is too high. In this work, I present the reference for small, medium, and large effect sizes for typing experiments based on a meta-analysis of well-cited papers from CHI conference. This effect size ruler can be used to conduct a priori power analysis or assess the magnitude of the found effect. This work also includes comparisons to other fields and conclude with a discussion of the existing issues with reporting practices and data availability.

Despite their wide use, the results after the use of gamified solutions are not always as good as expected. This can be due to several factors: there isn’t a standard procedure for gamification design, there’s a lack of methodological rigor and control over the data collection and data analysis. In this work, we present GamiDOC, a web-based solution to support designers during the software design, development and analysis through the use of a gamification design model and its review, a methods design control, an aid in the code generation, and an exhaustive list of standardized UX questionnaire according to the context of use.";;10.1145/3505270.3558345;https://doi.org/10.1145/3505270.3558345;;;design model, gamification, tool-support;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

While there has been research into the adaptation of games for training, assessment of user knowledge as a whole for the purpose of creating tailored training content has not been closely examined. In this paper, we propose a general framework for creating an assessment game and show how Knowledge Assessment can be used to guide the focus of subsequent training modules. Using our framework, we address the frustration and anxiety expressed by medical and nursing professionals about their lack of training regarding indicators of child physical abuse (CPA) in the United States. We develop the Computer Simulated Interactive Child Abuse Screening Tool (CSI-CAST), which contains scenarios in a serious game and uses assistive AI technologies to assess a group of users and discover features that are important in indicating the users' collective knowledge identifying CPA. A user study is conducted to show that CSI-CAST is easy to use and it functions to discover specific training needs.;;10.1145/3337722.3337747;https://doi.org/10.1145/3337722.3337747;;;child physical abuse, educational game, game design, knowledge assessment, serious game, video game;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Code to Cope: Supporting Self-Care by Integrating Creative Coding and Coping Mechanisms;Nam, Hye Yeon and Webb, Andrew M. and Tucker, Raymond and Harmon, Brendan;;2023;ACM Digital Library;162–170;;Code to Cope is a STEAM curriculum for young adults designed to teach, develop, and encourage coping mechanisms while learning programming with JavaScript. COVID-19 restrictions, such as social distancing and remote learning, disrupted social development and identity formation in young adults, exacerbating mental health issues that remain unaddressed in existing STEAM curriculum. Young adults are vulnerable to psychological distress that adversely affects educational experiences and career path choices. The Code to Cope curriculum was adopted by the creative coding course at Louisiana State University from 2021 to 2022. We conducted interviews with four students in 2021 and empirical studies with 34 students in 2022 to evaluate the effects of the curriculum in terms of code, coping, and creativity. The results of the study show that the Code to Cope curriculum effectively teaches computational thinking, develops self-care practices, and engages and motivates students.;;10.1145/3591196.3593335;https://doi.org/10.1145/3591196.3593335;;;Code to cope, STEAM education, coping mechanisms, creative coding, self-care;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;A New Traffic Sign Recognition Technique Taking Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm into Account;Demokri Dizji, Pouya and Joudaki, Saba and Kolivand, Hoshang;Wirel. Pers. Commun.;2022;ACM Digital Library;3425–3441;125;Everyday humans use cars to move faster, and the world is a chaotic place, and a little distraction or a mistake could be the reason for an accident and bring people great pain. An assistance system that can distinguish and detect signs on the roads and brings the driver's attention to road signs and make them aware of their meaning could be beneficial. The most important part of the Traffic Sign Recognition System is the algorithm. In this paper, a new way toward Traffic Sign Recognition algorithm taking the advantages of Color Segmentation, support vector machines, and histograms of oriented gradients on the GTSRB dataset is proposed. The unsupervised shuffled frog-leaping algorithm is employed for segmenting the images. The results show remarkable improvements by using meta-heuristic algorithms.;;10.1007/s11277-022-09718-7;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11277-022-09718-7;;;TSR, SFLA, Memeplex, HOG, Unsupervised segmentation, SVM;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0929-6212;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

It was organized as an educational and research project to tap into the dynamics of transdisciplinary teams challenged with a specific requirement. In our case, it was to build a Bauhaus-themed German Language Learning VR App. We constructed this experiment to simulate how representatives of different disciplines may work together towards a very specific purpose under time pressure. So, each participating team consisted of members of various expert-fields: software development (Unity or Unreal), design, psychology and linguistics. The results of this study cast light on the recommended cycle of design thinking and customer-centered design in VR. Especially in interdisciplinary rapid prototyping conditions, where stakeholders initially do not share competences. They also showcase educational benefits of working in transdisciplinary environments. This study, combined with our previous work on human factors in rapid software development and co-design, including hackathon dynamics, allowed us to formulate recommendations for organizing content creation VR hackathons for specific purposes. We also provide guidelines on how to prepare the participants to work in rapid prototyping VR environments and benefit from such experiences in the long term.;;10.1145/3411763.3443432;https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3443432;;;VR, hackathon, language learning, participatory design, teamwork;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Modelling on mobile devices: A systematic mapping study;Brunschwig, L\'{e}a and Guerra, Esther and de Lara, Juan;Softw. Syst. Model.;2022;ACM Digital Library;179–205;21;Modelling is central to many disciplines in engineering and the natural and social sciences. A wide variety of modelling languages and tools have been proposed along the years, traditionally for static environments such as desktops and laptops. However, the availability of increasingly powerful mobile devices makes it possible to profit from their embedded sensors and components (e.g. camera, microphone, GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope) for modelling. This has promoted a new range of modelling tools specially designed for their use in mobility. Such tools open the door to modelling in dynamic scenarios that go beyond the capabilities of traditional desktop tools. For example, modelling in mobility can be useful to design smart factories on-site, or to create models of hiking routes while walking along the routes, among many other scenarios. In this paper, we report on a systematic mapping study to identify the state of the art and trends in modelling on mobile devices. The study covers both research papers and modelling apps from the Android and iOS stores. From this analysis, we derive a classification for mobile modelling tools along three orthogonal dimensions, discuss current gaps, and propose avenues for further research.;;10.1007/s10270-021-00897-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-021-00897-8;;;Model-driven engineering, Modelling tools, Mobile devices, Systematic mapping study;Springer-Verlag;1619-1366;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Proprioception and audio feedback as a means of accessible 3D interaction for the visually impaired;de Souza Veriscimo, Erico and J\'{u}nior, Jo\~{a}o Luiz Bernardes;;2019;ACM Digital Library;;;The World Health Organization estimates that there are 285 million people with severe visual impairment in the world. With the advent of technology, virtual 3D environments are increasingly being used in several applications. Many of these applications, however, are not accessible to users with visual impairment. Our goal is to develop an innovative technique for 3D interaction to allow the identification of virtual objects with autonomy by the users, exploring only proprioception, audio feedback and low cost devices. We developed a prototype application implementing this technique and then ran an experiment with 8 visually impaired participants, who should use it to differentiate between virtual objects. Results were rather positive, with approximately 84% of correct answers without any prior training. This suggests that our proposed technique can benefit people with visual impairment in tasks that require interaction with 3D virtual objects in different areas of application, including in education. And it does so with good usability and accessibility as well as using only existing devices with relatively low cost and good availability.;;10.1145/3357155.3358467;https://doi.org/10.1145/3357155.3358467;;;3D user interfaces, accessibility, visual impairment;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Recent work has made significant progress in understanding and adapting user interfaces with traditional constraint/rule-based optimization and machine learning-based data-driven approaches; however, these two approaches remain separate. Combining the two approaches has great potential to advance the area but remains under-explored and challenging. Other contributions, such as datasets for potential applications, novel representations of user interfaces, the analysis of human traces, and models with multi-modalities, will also open up future research options.

;Employing an IoT Framework as a Generic Serious Games Analytics Engine;Lazzaroni, Luca and Mazzara, Andrea and Bellotti, Francesco and De Gloria, Alessandro and Berta, Riccardo;;2020;ACM Digital Library;79–88;;This paper proposes the use of a new data toolchain for serious games analytics. The toolchain relies on the open source Measurify Internet of Things (IoT) framework, and particularly takes advantage of its edge computing extension (namely, Edgine), which can be seamlessly deployed cross-platform on embedded devices and PCs as well. The Edgine is programmed to download from Measurify a set of scripts, that are periodically executed so to get data from sensors, pre-process them and send the extracted information to the Measurify APIs. Virtual sensors can be built in game engine scripts. This paper describes the implementation of the plug-in which deploys Edgine in Unity 3D, allowing an easy delivery of virtual sensor information to Measurify. Just as a proof of concept, we present the utilization of the whole chain within a trivial game scene, showing the application development efficiency provided by a tool which is made available open source to researchers and developers.;;10.1007/978-3-030-63464-3_8;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63464-3_8;;;Internet of Things, System architecture, Game development, Game engine plug-in, Virtual sensors, Reality-enhanced games;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Visualizing a collective student model for procedural training environments;Riofr\'{\i}o-Luzcando, D. and Ram\'{\i}rez, J. and Moral, C. and Antonio, A. and Berrocal-Lobo, M.;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2019;ACM Digital Library;10983–11010;78;"Visualization plays a relevant role for discovering patterns in big sets of data. In fact, the most common way to help a human with a pattern interpretation is through a graphic. In 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training the student interaction is more varied and complex than in traditional e-learning environments. Therefore, the visualization and interpretation of students' behaviors becomes a challenge. This motivated us to design the visualization of a collective student model built from student logs taken from 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training. This paper presents the design decisions that enable a suitable visualization of this model to instructors as well as a web tool that implements this visualization and is intended: to help instructors to improve their own teaching; and to enhance the tutoring strategy of an Intelligent Tutoring System.

;MAPO: A Multi-Objective Model for IoT Application Placement in a Fog Environment;Mehran, Narges and Kimovski, Dragi and Prodan, Radu;;2019;ACM Digital Library;;;The emergence of the Fog computing paradigm that leverages innetwork virtualized resources raises important challenges in terms of resource and IoT application management in a heterogeneous environment with limited computing resources. In this work, we propose a novel Pareto-based approach for application placement close to the data sources called Multi-objective IoT Application Placement in fOg (MAPO). MAPO models applications based on a finite state machine using three conflicting optimization objectives, completion time, energy consumption, and economic cost, and considering both the computation and communication aspects. In contrast to existing solutions that optimize a single objective, MAPO enables multi-objective energy and cost-aware application placement. To evaluate the quality of the MAPO placements, we created both simulated and real-world testbeds tailored for a set of medical IoT application case studies. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, MAPO reduces the economic cost by 28%, while decreasing the energy requirements by 29-64% on average, and improves the completion time by a factor of six.;;10.1145/3365871.3365892;https://doi.org/10.1145/3365871.3365892;;;Fog computing, IoT application placement, energy consumption, multi-objective optimization;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Technol.;2021;ACM Digital Library;1–25;24;Frequency of malware attacks because Android apps are increasing day by day. Current studies have revealed startling facts about data harvesting incidents, where user’s personal data is at stake. To preserve privacy of users, a permission induced risk interface MalApp to identify privacy violations rising from granting permissions during app installation is proposed. It comprises of multi-fold process that performs static analysis based on app’s category. First, concept of reverse engineering is applied to extract app permissions to construct a Boolean-valued permission matrix.  Second, ranking of permissions is done to identify the risky permissions across category. Third, machine learning and ensembling techniques have been incorporated to test the efficacy of the proposed approach on a data set of 404 benign and 409 malicious apps. The empirical studies have identified that our proposed algorithm gives a best case malware detection rate of 98.33%. The highlight of interface is that any app can be classified as benign or malicious even before running it using static analysis.;;10.4018/JCIT.20220701.oa6;https://doi.org/10.4018/JCIT.20220701.oa6;;;Android OS, Benign, Ensembling, Heuristic Approach, Machine Learning, Malware, Permission Ranking, Permissions, Risk-Relevance;IGI Global;1548-7717;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Literature review of Industry 4.0 and related technologies;Oztemel, Ercan and Gursev, Samet;J. Intell. Manuf.;2020;ACM Digital Library;127–182;31;Manufacturing industry profoundly impact economic and societal progress. As being a commonly accepted term for research centers and universities, the Industry 4.0 initiative has received a splendid attention of the business and research community. Although the idea is not new and was on the agenda of academic research in many years with different perceptions, the term “Industry 4.0” is just launched and well accepted to some extend not only in academic life but also in the industrial society as well. While academic research focuses on understanding and defining the concept and trying to develop related systems, business models and respective methodologies, industry, on the other hand, focuses its attention on the change of industrial machine suits and intelligent products as well as potential customers on this progress. It is therefore important for the companies to primarily understand the features and content of the Industry 4.0 for potential transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. In order to achieve a successful transformation, they should clearly review their positions and respective potentials against basic requirements set forward for Industry 4.0 standard. This will allow them to generate a well-defined road map. There has been several approaches and discussions going on along this line, a several road maps are already proposed. Some of those are reviewed in this paper. However, the literature clearly indicates the lack of respective assessment methodologies. Since the implementation and applications of related theorems and definitions outlined for the 4th industrial revolution is not mature enough for most of the reel life implementations, a systematic approach for making respective assessments and evaluations seems to be urgently required for those who are intending to speed this transformation up. It is now main responsibility of the research community to developed technological infrastructure with physical systems, management models, business models as well as some well-defined Industry 4.0 scenarios in order to make the life for the practitioners easy. It is estimated by the experts that the Industry 4.0 and related progress along this line will have an enormous effect on social life. As outlined in the introduction, some social transformation is also expected. It is assumed that the robots will be more dominant in manufacturing, implanted technologies, cooperating and coordinating machines, self-decision-making systems, autonom problem solvers, learning machines, 3D printing etc. will dominate the production process. Wearable internet, big data analysis, sensor based life, smart city implementations or similar applications will be the main concern of the community. This social transformation will naturally trigger the manufacturing society to improve their manufacturing suits to cope with the customer requirements and sustain competitive advantage. A summary of the potential progress along this line is reviewed in introduction of the paper. It is so obvious that the future manufacturing systems will have a different vision composed of products, intelligence, communications and information network. This will bring about new business models to be dominant in industrial life. Another important issue to take into account is that the time span of this so-called revolution will be so short triggering a continues transformation process to yield some new industrial areas to emerge. This clearly puts a big pressure on manufacturers to learn, understand, design and implement the transformation process. Since the main motivation for finding the best way to follow this transformation, a comprehensive literature review will generate a remarkable support. This paper presents such a review for highlighting the progress and aims to help improve the awareness on the best experiences. It is intended to provide a clear idea for those wishing to generate a road map for digitizing the respective m;;10.1007/s10845-018-1433-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-018-1433-8;;;Industry 4.0, Smart factory, Internet of things (IoT), Cyber-physical systems, Cloud systems, Big data;Springer-Verlag;0956-5515;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Appl.;2020;ACM Digital Library;115–153;34;Hardware, applications, and software are equally important to the comprehensive strength of a country in the high-performance computing (HPC) arena. China has made significant progress in developing HPC systems in recent years. The nation’s first win of the Gordon Bell Prize at Supercomputing 2016 (SC16) also represents an accomplishment in HPC applications. China’s subsequent win in 2017 shows that the 2016 accomplishment was no accident. However, lacking adequately reliable and scalable application software remains the biggest challenge for China. Scientists and engineers who can develop algorithms and software to effectively use supercomputers are in short supply. The present report describes the current HPC software development landscape in China, including government projects and leading universities/research organizations/companies in terms of developing application software and programming frameworks (middleware), as well as examples of self-developed software in the application areas of energy and physics, aerospace, manufacturing, weather and climate, biotechnology (biotech), material science, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics.

Multimedia applications can now be found across many application domains including but not limited to entertainment, communication, health, business, and education. It is becoming more and more important to understand the factors that influence user perceptual quality, and hence monitoring user quality of experience (QoE) for improving multimedia interaction and services is essential. In this PhD work, we propose advanced machine learning techniques to predict QoE from physiological signals for immersive multimedia experiences. The aim of this doctoral study is to investigate the utility of physiological responses for QoE assessment for different multimedia technologies.

Commun.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1423–1452;132;The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that permits the integration of all objects into an Internet environment. IoT has spawned numerous intelligent applications and services to benefit organizations, society, and consumer experiences. On the other hand, traditional computing methods are incapable of handling the demands of these services. The advent of cloud computing methods that provides software, platform, and infrastructure such as services have realized these applications. However, one of the critical obstacles of real-time cloud-based IoT applications is service response time. Edge computing solutions have been developed to address these issues. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of driving enforce edge computing for IoT applications on aspects of the research timeline, applications, vision, challenges, and open research issues. Through this, we highlight the benefits of edge computing over cloud computing in almost domains.

;Computation offloading strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for connected and autonomous vehicle in vehicular edge computing;Lin, Bing and Lin, Kai and Lin, Changhang and Lu, Yu and Huang, Ziqing and Chen, Xinwei;J. Cloud Comput.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;10;Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) is a transformative technology that has great potential to improve urban traffic and driving safety. Electric Vehicle (EV) is becoming the key subject of next-generation CAVs by virtue of its advantages in energy saving. Due to the limited endurance and computing capacity of EVs, it is challenging to meet the surging demand for computing-intensive and delay-sensitive in-vehicle intelligent applications. Therefore, computation offloading has been employed to extend a single vehicle’s computing capacity. Although various offloading strategies have been proposed to achieve good computing performace in the Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) environment, it remains challenging to jointly optimize the offloading failure rate and the total energy consumption of the offloading process. To address this challenge, in this paper, we establish a computation offloading model based on Markov Decision Process (MDP), taking into consideration task dependencies, vehicle mobility, and different computing resources for task offloading. We then design a computation offloading strategy based on deep reinforcement learning, and leverage the Deep Q-Network based on Simulated Annealing (SA-DQN) algorithm to optimize the joint objectives. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy effectively reduces the offloading failure rate and the total energy consumption for application offloading.;;10.1186/s13677-021-00246-6;https://doi.org/10.1186/s13677-021-00246-6;;;Computation offloading, Connected and autonomous vehicle, Reinforcement learning, Simulated annealing, Offloading failure, Energy consumption, Mobility;Hindawi Limited;2192-113X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Challenges of modeling and analysis in cybermanufacturing: a review from a machine learning and computation perspective;Kang, SungKu and Jin, Ran and Deng, Xinwei and Kenett, Ron S.;J. Intell. Manuf.;2021;ACM Digital Library;415–428;34;In Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing is facing its next stage, cybermanufacturing, founded upon advanced communication, computation, and control infrastructure. Cybermanufacturing will unleash the potential of multi-modal manufacturing data, and provide a new perspective called computation service, as a part of service-oriented architecture (SOA), where on-demand computation requests throughout manufacturing operations are seamlessly satisfied by data analytics and machine learning. However, the complexity of information technology infrastructure leads to fundamental challenges in modeling and analysis under cybermanufacturing, ranging from information-poor datasets to a lack of reproducibility of analytical studies. Nevertheless, existing reviews have focused on the overall architecture of cybermanufacturing/SOA or its technical components (e.g., communication protocol), rather than the potential bottleneck of computation service with respect to modeling and analysis. In this paper, we review the fundamental challenges with respect to modeling and analysis in cybermanufacturing. Then, we introduce the existing efforts in computation pipeline recommendation, which aims at identifying an optimal sequence of method options for data analytics/machine learning without time-consuming trial-and-error. We envision computation pipeline recommendation as a promising research field to address the fundamental challenges in cybermanufacturing. We also expect that computation pipeline recommendation can be a driving force to flexible and resilient manufacturing operations in the post-COVID-19 industry.;;10.1007/s10845-021-01817-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-021-01817-9;;;Computation pipelines, Cybermanufacturing, Industry 4.0, Machine learning, Manufacturing modeling and analysis;Springer-Verlag;0956-5515;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The extracted characteristics include statistical and higher order statistical features, technical indicators, raw features, information gain and improved entropy. This procedure is then applied to the pre-processed data. Finally, the detection phase receives the retrieved characteristics, here Hybrid Classifier (HC), including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is used.

;PointCA: evaluating the robustness of 3D point cloud completion models against adversarial examples;Hu, Shengshan and Zhang, Junwei and Liu, Wei and Hou, Junhui and Li, Minghui and Zhang, Leo Yu and Jin, Hai and Sun, Lichao;;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;Point cloud completion, as the upstream procedure of 3D recognition and segmentation, has become an essential part of many tasks such as navigation and scene understanding. While various point cloud completion models have demonstrated their powerful capabilities, their robustness against adversarial attacks, which have been proven to be fatally malicious towards deep neural networks, remains unknown. In addition, existing attack approaches towards point cloud classifiers cannot be applied to the completion models due to different output forms and attack purposes. In order to evaluate the robustness of the completion models, we propose PointCA, the first adversarial attack against 3D point cloud completion models. PointCA can generate adversarial point clouds that maintain high similarity with the original ones, while being completed as another object with totally different semantic information. Specifically, we minimize the representation discrepancy between the adversarial example and the target point set to jointly explore the adversarial point clouds in the geometry space and the feature space. Furthermore, to launch a stealthier attack, we innovatively employ the neighbourhood density information to tailor the perturbation constraint, leading to geometry-aware and distribution-adaptive modification for each point. Extensive experiments against different premier point cloud completion networks show that PointCA can cause a performance degradation from 77.9% to 16.7%, with the structure chamfer distance kept below 0.01. We conclude that existing completion models are severely vulnerable to adversarial examples, and state-of-the-art defenses for point cloud classification will be partially invalid when applied to incomplete and uneven point cloud data.;;10.1609/aaai.v37i1.25166;https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i1.25166;;;;AAAI Press;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Transfer learning-based lung segmentation and pneumonia detection for paediatric chest X-ray images;Fernandes, Vandecia and Bras, Gabriel and Paiva, Lisle Faray de and Junior, Geraldo Braz and Paiva, Anselmo Cardoso de and Rivero, Luis;Int. J. Innov. Comput. Appl.;2023;ACM Digital Library;56–66;14;Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in under-five children, especially in developing countries. Accordingly to UNICEF and World Health Organization, a child dies of pneumonia every 39 seconds, and pneumonia kills more children than any other infectious disease, accounting for 15% of all deaths of children under five years old. In regions with a high prevalence, the early detection and treatment of pneumonia can significantly reduce children's mortality rates. Commonly, a chest X-ray is a diagnostic exam. Nevertheless, it is a problematic image for reading and interprets, requiring an expert physician. So, it is essential to provide computational methods to help exam interpretation or enhance important information. This paper proposes a transfer learning method to segment lung regions on the chest X-ray dataset to extract ROI for pneumonia detection. The results are promising and reach 0.917 of dice using U-Net combined with InceptionV3 in a chest X-ray dataset without lung annotation. For pneumonia detection, the method achieves 0.954 precision.;;10.1504/ijica.2023.129358;https://doi.org/10.1504/ijica.2023.129358;;;pneumonia, transfer learning, deep learning, segmentation;Inderscience Publishers;1751-648X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;An Exploration Towards Sustainable Metaverse Systems for e-Learning by Student Designers: A Meta-analysis;Lee, Chien-Sing;;2023;ACM Digital Library;511–530;;"The metaverse has caught the imagination and investments of many. However, in developing countries, the metaverse may raise more questions, than answers. As such, this study aims to investigate first, student-designers’ perceptions towards what and how they want the metaverse to be like, and whether students would prioritize information flow; second, the efficacy of triangulating 3 usability-HCI questionnaires; third, whether student-designers would be more interested, creative, and be more confident in designing and developing for interconnecting (non) metaverse (eco)systems. Findings from alpha-beta user testings of Figma prototypes indicate preference for balance between structure and freedom/creativity, enhanced by user feedback and open ecosystems. Mind maps, sequencing of chain of effects in descending order, and the derived hierarchical relationship reflect centralities in design, and continuums in notions of what sustainable interconnected systems in the metaverse may be like. They are influenced by how perspectives, objectives, utility functions, and evaluation criteria, dynamically affect shifts in these centrality of design (dy/dx) over time (dy/dt), based on demographics. Loosely coupled pointer-based systems, are thus viable complements to integration.";;10.1007/978-3-031-37126-4_33;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-37126-4_33;;;Interest, Student designers, Information theory, Flow, Design thinking, Computational thinking, Metaverse, Complementary interconnected ecosystems, Future knowledge management, Recommender;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Self-supervised learning of monocular 3D geometry understanding with two- and three-view geometric constraints;Liu, Xiaoliang and Shen, Furao and Zhao, Jian and Nie, Changhai;Vis. Comput.;2023;ACM Digital Library;1193–1204;40;The 3D geometry understanding of dynamic scenes captured by moving cameras is one of the cornerstones of 3D scene understanding. Optical flow estimation, visual odometry, and depth estimation are the three most basic tasks in 3D geometry understanding. In this work, we present a unified framework for joint self-supervised learning of optical flow estimation, visual odometry, and depth estimation with two- and three-view geometric constraints. As we all know, visual odometry and depth estimation are more sensitive to dynamic objects, while optical flow estimation is more difficult to estimate the boundary area moved out of the image. To this end, we use estimated optical flow to help visual odometry and depth estimation process dynamic objects and use a rigid flow synthesized by the estimated pose and depth to help learn the optical flow of the area that moves out of the boundary due to camera motion. In order to further improve the consistency of cross-tasks, we introduce three-view geometric constraints and propose a three-view consistency loss. Finally, experiments on the KITTI data set show that our method can effectively improve the performance of the occluded boundary area and the dynamic object area. Moreover, our method achieves comparable or better performance than other monocular self-supervised state-of-the-art methods in these three subtasks.;;10.1007/s00371-023-02840-y;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-023-02840-y;;;3D geometry understanding, Optical flow estimation, Visual odometry, Depth estimation, Self-supervised learning, Dynamic scenes;Springer-Verlag;0178-2789;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;On the Cognitive Load of Online Learners With Multi-Level Data Mining;Liu, Lingyan and Zhao, Bo and Rao, Yiqiang;Int. J. Inf. Commun. Technol. Educ.;2022;ACM Digital Library;1–15;18;A lot of studies have shown that there is an “inverse U-curve” relationship between learners' grades and cognitive load. Learners' grades are closely related to their learning behavior characteristics on online learning. Is there any relationship between online learners' behavior characteristics and cognitive load? Based on this, the data of research are obtained from the professions and applied sciences on the Canvas Network platform. The multi-level data mining technology is used to analyze and mine the relationship between grades and online learners' behavior characteristics layer by layer. The results show that there is an “inverse U-curve” relationship between grades and “nevents.” Therefore, the research attempts to map “nevents” to the online learners' cognitive load, which makes the online learners' cognitive load can be quantitative analysis. Research results also prove that multi-level data mining technology can be used to mine the special learning rules hidden behind the data effectively.;;10.4018/ijicte.314225;https://doi.org/10.4018/ijicte.314225;;;Cognitive Load, Grade, Learning Analytic, Multi-Level Data Mining, Online Learning Behavior Characteristics;IGI Global;1550-1876;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;How is Transient Behavior Addressed in Practice? Insights from a Series of Expert Interviews;Beck, Samuel and Frank, Sebastian and Hakamian, Alireza and van Hoorn, Andr\'{e};;2022;ACM Digital Library;105–112;;Transient behavior occurs when a running software system changes from one steady-state to another. In microservice systems, such disruptions can, for example, be caused by continuous deployment, self-adaptation, and various failures. Although transient behavior could be captured in non-functional requirements, little is known of how that is handled in practice. Our objective was to study how architects and engineers approach runtime disruptions, which challenges they face, whether or not they specify transient behavior, and how currently employed tools and methods can be improved. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five experienced practitioners from major companies in Germany. We found that a big challenge in the industry is a lack of awareness of transient behavior by software stakeholders. Consequently, they often do not consider specifying it in non-functional requirements. Additionally, better tooling is needed to reduce the effort of analyzing transient behavior. We present two prototypes that we developed corresponding to these findings to improve the current situation. Beyond that, the insights we present can serve as pointers for interesting research directions for other researchers.;;10.1145/3491204.3527483;https://doi.org/10.1145/3491204.3527483;;;microservices, non-functional requirements, transient behavior;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Machine learning techniques for software vulnerability prediction: a comparative study;Jabeen, Gul and Rahim, Sabit and Afzal, Wasif and Khan, Dawar and Khan, Aftab Ahmed and Hussain, Zahid and Bibi, Tehmina;Applied Intelligence;2022;ACM Digital Library;17614–17635;52;Software vulnerabilities represent a major cause of security problems. Various vulnerability discovery models (VDMs) attempt to model the rate at which the vulnerabilities are discovered in a software. Although several VDMs have been proposed, not all of them are universally applicable. Also most of them seldom give accurate predictive results for every type of vulnerability dataset. The use of machine learning (ML) techniques has generally found success in a wide range of predictive tasks. Thus, in this paper, we conducted an empirical study on applying some well-known machine learning (ML) techniques as well as statistical techniques to predict the software vulnerabilities on a variety of datasets. The following ML techniques have been evaluated: cascade-forward back propagation neural network, feed-forward back propagation neural network, adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, bagging, M5Rrule, M5P and reduced error pruning tree. The following statistical techniques have been evaluated: Alhazmi-Malaiya model, linear regression and logistic regression model. The applicability of the techniques is examined using two separate approaches: goodness-of-fit to see how well the model tracks the data, and prediction capability using different criteria. It is observed that ML techniques show remarkable improvement in predicting the software vulnerabilities than the statistical vulnerability prediction models.;;10.1007/s10489-022-03350-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-03350-5;;;Software vulnerability, Machine learning, Prediction models;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0924-669X;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Front-end deep learning web apps development and deployment: a review;Goh, Hock-Ann and Ho, Chin-Kuan and Abas, Fazly Salleh;Applied Intelligence;2022;ACM Digital Library;15923–15945;53;Machine learning and deep learning models are commonly developed using programming languages such as Python, C++, or R and deployed as web apps delivered from a back-end server or as mobile apps installed from an app store. However, recently front-end technologies and JavaScript libraries, such as TensorFlow.js, have been introduced to make machine learning more accessible to researchers and end-users. Using JavaScript, TensorFlow.js can define, train, and run new or existing, pre-trained machine learning models entirely in the browser from the client-side, which improves the user experience through interaction while preserving privacy. Deep learning models deployed on front-end browsers must be small, have fast inference, and ideally be interactive in real-time. Therefore, the emphasis on development and deployment is different. This paper aims to review the development and deployment of these deep-learning web apps to raise awareness of the recent advancements and encourage more researchers to take advantage of this technology for their own work. First, the rationale behind the deployment stack (front-end, JavaScript, and TensorFlow.js) is discussed. Then, the development approach for obtaining deep learning models that are optimized and suitable for front-end deployment is then described. The article also provides current web applications divided into seven categories to show deep learning potential on the front end. These include web apps for deep learning playground, pose detection and gesture tracking, music and art creation, expression detection and facial recognition, video segmentation, image and signal analysis, healthcare diagnosis, recognition, and identification.;;10.1007/s10489-022-04278-6;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-04278-6;;;Deep learning web apps, TensorFlow.js, Front-end deep learning, Browser-based deep learning, Client-side deep learning;Kluwer Academic Publishers;0924-669X;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Vehicular edge computing is an efficient paradigm for enabling low-latency and high-quality service. In this paper, we consider a multi-period task offloading scenario in vehicular edge computing environment, where tasks can be offloaded in any period during their lifetime. Then, we formulate the multi-period offloading problem (MOP) to maximize the task completion ratio, by analyzing the mobility-aware communication model, resources-aware computation model and deadline-aware award model. Further, considering the high mobility of vehicles and dynamic wireless environments, we propose a real-time distributed strategy (RtDS) to solve MOP by exploiting the collaboration among edge nodes and client vehicles. Finally, we build the simulation model based on real vehicular trajectories and give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates the superior performance of RtDS.;;10.1007/s00521-021-05766-5;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-05766-5;;;Vehicular edge computing, Multi-period task offloading, Real-time, Distributed strategy;Springer-Verlag;0941-0643;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

This architecture can be used to simulate three environments that are: a) Driver's environment; b) Pedestrian environment; c) Vehicle traffic observer environment. All these environments are controlled by intelligent agents that allow the user to handle the autonomous longitudinal control, the relative distance, the speed of the cars, the collisions between vehicles, the pedestrian collision, excess of the speed limit, circulation in the opposite direction, and respect of traffic signals.

Initially, the study devises a novel cooperative vehicular fog cloud network (VFCN) based on container microservices which offers cost-efficient and mobility-aware services with rich resources for processing. This study devises the cost-efficient task offloading and scheduling (CEMOTS) algorithm framework, which consists of the mobility aware task offloading phase (MTOP) method, which determines the optimal offloading time to minimize the communication cost of applications. Furthermore, CEMOTS offers Cooperative Task Offloading Scheduling (CTOS), including task sequencing and scheduling.

;Systematic mapping of the literature on mobile apps for people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder;Krause, Maico and Neto, Macilon Ara\'{u}jo Costa;;2021;ACM Digital Library;45–52;;The advancement of mobile technologies combined with assistive technologies can provide autonomy to people with different types of disabilities, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Technologies, such as those found in mobile devices, are very attractive to people with ASD and can be used as a valuable educational tool for these individuals. The aim of this study was to learn about how mobile apps aimed at people with ASD are developed and evaluated, carried out through a systematic mapping of applications aimed at people with ASD, in order to better understand their foundations, motivations, evaluation mode, resources and user profile. The results indicated that the main procedures used to support the applications for people with ASD are the questionnaires to identify the ASD, such as the CHAT and AQ-10, and the ABA intervention, and that these applications, mostly, seek to identify the ASD in a practical way and at a low cost. Most of the apps were evaluated by usability testing and through indirect observation through the app's logs. The most used hardware and software resources are the mobile device camera and convolutional neural networks (CNN), respectively, with most applications aimed at children and the most common software engineering methodologies were requirements analysis and prototyping.;;10.1145/3470482.3479616;https://doi.org/10.1145/3470482.3479616;;;Apps, Autistic Spectrum Disorder, Mobile Devices, Systematic Mapping;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Commun. Mob. Comput.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;2021;As the commercial implementations of 5G networks have been initiated in different regions of the world, the focus of the researchers is bending towards the next generation of wireless communication. This research study intends to investigate the requisites of the fast establishment of the theoretical and practical measures for sixth generation (6G) wireless communication. To this end, this paper first outlined the existing research works that have considered different aspects of 6G, and then based on this existing works, the future vision is established. Then, the 6G vision is based on four types of connectivity and is summarized as “Wherever you think, everything follows your heart.” To fill the gap between the market requirements after one decade and the limited capabilities of 5G, different specifications of 6G that make it an appropriate replacement are discussed. Furthermore, different candidate technologies that can potentially realize the 6G communication are studied, followed by discussion on different challenges in the realization and possible research directions to cope with these challenges. By exploring the vision of future, its specification, and key candidate technologies, this paper attempts to summarize the general 6G framework. In addition, with mentioned challenges in realization of 6G, the aim of this paper is to guide the researcher and attract their interest to consider them.;;10.1155/2021/9614520;https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9614520;;;;John Wiley and Sons Ltd.;1530-8669;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;SLA-ORECS: an SLA-oriented framework for reallocating resources in edge-cloud systems;Lan, Shizhan and Duan, Zhuoxi and Lu, Song and Tan, Bin and Chen, Shi and Liang, Yeyu and Chen, Shan;J. Cloud Comput.;2024;ACM Digital Library;;13;The emergence of the Fifth Generation (5G) era has ushered in a new era of diverse business scenarios, primarily characterized by data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications. Edge computing technology integrates the information services environment with cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the network. However, the evolving landscape of business models necessitates a unified edge architecture capable of accommodating diverse requirements, posing substantial challenges for service providers in meeting Service-Level Agreements (SLAs).In response to these challenges, we introduce SLA-ORECS. This innovative framework dynamically allocates dedicated and shared resources within the edge-cloud system to cater to service requests with varying SLAs, thereby facilitating performance isolation. Furthermore, we have developed an optimization algorithm to enhance the efficiency of SLA assurance during request dispatch.The evaluation of SLA-ORECS highlights its noteworthy performance improvements, particularly in terms of system throughput and average time consumption.;;10.1186/s13677-023-00561-0;https://doi.org/10.1186/s13677-023-00561-0;;;Edge-cloud system, Service-level agreement (SLA), Performance isolation;Hindawi Limited;2192-113X;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design: Statistics, Digital Signal Processing, and Machine Learning in Practice;;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;34;Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.;;;;;;;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;TripRes: Traffic Flow Prediction Driven Resource Reservation for Multimedia IoV with Edge Computing;Xu, Xiaolong and Fang, Zijie and Qi, Lianyong and Zhang, Xuyun and He, Qiang and Zhou, Xiaokang;ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;17;The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) connects vehicles, roadside units (RSUs) and other intelligent objects, enabling data sharing among them, thereby improving the efficiency of urban traffic and safety. Currently, collections of multimedia content, generated by multimedia surveillance equipment, vehicles, and so on, are transmitted to edge servers for implementation, because edge computing is a formidable paradigm for accommodating multimedia services with low-latency resource provisioning. However, the uneven or discrete distribution of the traffic flow covered by edge servers negatively affects the service performance (e.g., overload and underload) of edge servers in multimedia IoV systems. Therefore, how to accurately schedule and dynamically reserve proper numbers of resources for multimedia services in edge servers is still challenging. To address this challenge, a traffic flow prediction driven resource reservation method, called TripRes, is developed in this article. Specifically, the city map is divided into different regions, and the edge servers in a region are treated as a “big edge server” to simplify the complex distribution of edge servers. Then, future traffic flows are predicted using the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet), and future traffic flows are used to estimate the amount of multimedia services each region needs to offload to the edge servers. With the number of services to be offloaded in each region, their offloading destinations are determined through latency-sensitive transmission path selection. Finally, the performance of TripRes is evaluated using real-world big data with over 100M multimedia surveillance records from RSUs in Nanjing China.;;10.1145/3401979;https://doi.org/10.1145/3401979;;;Resource reservation, edge computing, multimedia IoV, residual networks, traffic flow prediction;Association for Computing Machinery;1551-6857;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Distractor Effects on Crossing-Based Interaction;Tu, Huawei and Huang, Jin and Liang, Hai-Ning and Skarbez, Richard and Tian, Feng and Duh, Henry Been-Lirn;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;;Task-irrelevant distractors affect visuo-motor control for target acquisition and studying such effects has already received much attention in human-computer interaction. However, there has been little research into distractor effects on crossing-based interaction. We thus conducted an empirical study on pen-based interfaces to investigate six crossing tasks with distractor interference in comparison to two tasks without it. The six distractor-related tasks differed in movement precision constraint (directional/amplitude), target size, target distance, distractor location and target-distractor spacing. We also developed and experimentally validated six quantitative models for the six tasks. Our results show that crossing targets with distractors had longer average times and similar accuracy than that without distractors. The effects of distractors varied depending on distractor location, target-distractor spacing and movement precision constraint. When spacing is smaller than 11.27 mm, crossing tasks with distractor interference can be regarded as pointing tasks or a combination of pointing and crossing tasks, which could be better fitted with our proposed models than Fitts’ law. According to these results, we provide practical implications to crossing-based user interface design.;;10.1145/3411764.3445340;https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445340;;;Crossing, Fitts’ law, distractor effects, models., pointing;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Multi-modelling and Co-simulation in the Engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems: Towards the Digital Twin;Fitzgerald, John and Larsen, Peter Gorm and Pierce, Ken;;2022;ACM Digital Library;40–55;;Ensuring the dependability of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) poses challenges for model-based engineering, stemming from the semantic heterogeneity of the models of computational, physical and human processes, and from the range of stakeholders involved. We argue that delivering such dependability requires a marriage of multi-disciplinary models developed during design with models derived from real operational data. Assets developed during design thus become the basis of a learning digital twin, able to support decision making both in redesign and in responsive operation. Starting from an open integrated toolchain leveraging formal models for CPS design, we consider the extension of this concept towards digital twins. A small example inspired by agricultural robotics illustrates some of the opportunities for research and innovation in delivering digital twins that contribute to dependability.;;;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30985-5_4;;;;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Early Validation and Verification of System Behaviour in Model-Based Systems Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review;Cederbladh, Johan and Cicchetti, Antonio and Suryadevara, Jagadish;ACM Trans. Softw. Eng. Methodol.;2023;ACM Digital Library;;;"In the Systems Engineering (SE) domain there has been a paradigm shift from document-based to model-based system development artefacts; in fact, new methodologies are emerging to meet the increasing complexity of current systems and the corresponding growing need of digital workflows. In this regard, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is considered as a key enabler by many central players of the SE community. MBSE has reached an adequate level of maturity and there exist documented success stories in its adoption in industry. In particular, one significant benefit of utilising MBSE when compared to the traditional manual and document-centric workflows is that models are available from early phases of systems development; these enable a multitude of analyses prior any implementation effort together with other relevant capabilities, like the automation of development tasks. Nonetheless, it is noticeable there is a lack of a common understanding for how formal analyses for the verification and validation (V&amp;V) of systems behaviour, specifically in the early phases of development, could be placed in an MBSE setting. In this article, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic literature review regarding the early V&amp;V of systems behaviour in the context of model-based systems engineering. The review aims to provide a structured representation of the state-of-the-art with respect to motivations, proposed solutions, and limitations. From an initial set of potentially relevant 701 peer-reviewed publications we selected 149 primary studies, which we analysed according to a rigorous data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. Based on our results, early V&amp;V has usually the goal of checking the quality of a system design to avoid discovering flaws when parts are being concretely realised; SysML is a de facto standard for describing the system under study, while the solutions for the analyses tend to be varied; also V&amp;V analyses tend to target varied properties with a slight predominance of functional concerns, and following the variation mentioned so far the proposed solutions are largely context specific; the proposed approaches are usually presented without explicit limitations, while when limitations are discussed, readiness of the solutions, handling of analyses simplifications/assumptions, and languages/tools integration are among the most frequently mentioned issues. Based on the survey results and the standard SE practices, we discuss how the current state-of-the-art MBSE supports early V&amp;V of systems behaviour with a special focus on industrial adoption, and identify relevant challenges to be researched further.";;10.1145/3631976;https://doi.org/10.1145/3631976;;;MBSE, Validation, Verification, System behaviour, Systematic literature review;Association for Computing Machinery;1049-331X;;Just Accepted;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

While the Cloud has provided an excellent underpinning solution to store, manage and process data, it is becoming increasingly difficult, as the Cloud necessitates sending all data that is generated by billions of user devices and sensors to distant data centres far away from the data source. This is expected to make query processing and data analytics challenging. This paper examines the challenges in developing pragmatic solutions for processing queries and performing analytics using the emerging Edge computing paradigm. In this paradigm, compute infrastructure is offered at the edge of the network, which is closer to the data source. A simulation study to highlight the advantages of Edge computing over the Cloud is presented.;;;;;;;IBM Corp.;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The Application of Flipped Classroom Information Technology in English Teaching in the Context of 6G Network;Bi, Xiu and Ye, Shuping;Int. J. Inf. Commun. Technol. Educ.;2024;ACM Digital Library;1–18;20;In the 6G network environment, the flipped classroom teaching mode has broader prospective applications for improving the drawbacks of traditional classroom teaching methods. This study aims to explore the advantages of the flipped classroom teaching mode in the 6G network environment and provide feasible teaching strategies and guidance for English teachers. First, the authors collected information about Chinese English learners. Next, they divided the obtained dataset into two groups: the control group and the experimental group. The students in the control group continued to use traditional teaching methods for English teaching, while the students in the experimental group adopted a flipped classroom teaching mode supported by 6G technology. The results indicate that flipped classroom information technology in the 6G network environment has a good effect on English teaching. This article provides a useful reference for the education field and promotes the application of flipped classroom information technology in English teaching in the 6G network environment.;;10.4018/IJICTE.338322;https://doi.org/10.4018/IJICTE.338322;;;6G Technology, Learning-Based Multifunctional Dragonfly Algorithm, Students’ Performance;IGI Global;1550-1876;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;A Quality of Experience Evaluation of an Interactive Multisensory 2.5D Virtual Reality Art Exhibit;Chen, Chen and Murray, Niall and Keighrey, Conor;;2023;ACM Digital Library;170–173;;In recent years, museums have become more interactive and immersive through the adaptation of technology within large scale art exhibitions. Due to these changes, new types of cultural experiences are more appealing to a younger audience. Despite these positive changes, some museum experiences are still primarily focused on visual art experiences, which remain out of reach to those with visual impairments. Such unimodal and visual dominated experiences restrict these users who depend on sensory feedback to experience the world around them. In this paper, the authors propose a novel VR experience which incorporates multisensory technologies. It allows individuals to engage and interact with a visual artwork museum experience presented as a fully immersive VR environment. Users can interact with virtual paintings and trigger sensory zones which deliver multisensory feedback to the user. These sensory zones are unique to each painting, presenting thematic audio and smells, custom haptic feedback to feel the artwork, and lastly air, light and thermal changes in an effort to engage those with visual impairments.;;10.1145/3573381.3597214;https://doi.org/10.1145/3573381.3597214;;;Accessibility, Immersive Experience, Multisensory, Virtual Reality, Visual Impairment;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Demystifying Mobile Extended Reality in Web Browsers: How Far Can We Go?;Bi, Weichen and Ma, Yun and Tian, Deyu and Yang, Qi and Zhang, Mingtao and Jing, Xiang;;2023;ACM Digital Library;2960–2969;;Mobile extended reality (XR) has developed rapidly in recent years. Compared with the app-based XR, XR in web browsers has the advantages of being lightweight and cross-platform, providing users with a pervasive experience. Therefore, many frameworks are emerging to support the development of XR in web browsers. However, little has been known about how well these frameworks perform and how complex XR apps modern web browsers can support on mobile devices. To fill the knowledge gap, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study of mobile XR in web browsers. We select seven most popular web-based XR frameworks and investigate their runtime performance, including 3D rendering, camera capturing, and real-world understanding. We find that current frameworks have the potential to further enhance their performance by increasing GPU utilization or improving computing parallelism. Besides, for 3D scenes with good rendering performance, developers can feel free to add camera capturing with little influence on performance to support augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) applications. Based on our findings, we draw several practical implications to provide better XR support in web browsers.;;10.1145/3543507.3583329;https://doi.org/10.1145/3543507.3583329;;;Extended Reality, Measurement, Web browser;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

However, the main topics in this intersection are unclear, as are the benefits of combining XR and AI. This paper presents a scoping review that highlights how XR is applied in AI research and vice versa. We screened 2619 publications from 203 international venues published between 2017 and 2021, followed by an in-depth review of 311 papers. Based on our review, we identify five main topics at the intersection of XR and AI, showing how research at the intersection can benefit each other. Furthermore, we present a list of commonly used datasets, software, libraries, and models to help researchers interested in this intersection. Finally, we present 13 research opportunities and recommendations for future work in XR and AI research.;;10.1145/3544548.3581072;https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3581072;;;artificial intelligence, extended reality, scoping review;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Event-driven Programming in Programming Education: A Mapping Review;Lukkarinen, Aleksi and Malmi, Lauri and Haaranen, Lassi;ACM Trans. Comput. Educ.;2021;ACM Digital Library;;21;"During the past two decades, event-driven programming (EDP) has emerged as a central and almost ubiquitous concept in modern software development: Graphical user interfaces are self-evident in most mobile and web-based applications, as well as in many embedded systems, and they are most often based on reacting to events. To facilitate both teaching practice and research in programming education, this mapping review seeks to give an overview of the related knowledge that is already available in conference papers and journal articles. Starting from early works of the 1990s, we identified 105&nbsp;papers that address teaching practices, present learning resources, software tools or libraries to support learning, and empirical studies related to EDP. We summarize the publications, their main content, and findings. While most studies focus on bachelor’s level education in universities, there has been substantial work in K-12 level, as well. Few courses address EDP as their main content—rather it is most often integrated with CS1, CS2, or computer graphics courses. The most common programming languages and environments addressed are Java, App Inventor, and Scratch. Moreover, very little of deliberate experimental scientific research has been carried out to explicitly address teaching and learning EDP. Consequently, while so-called experience reports, tool papers, and anecdotal evidence have been published, this theme offers a wide arena for empirical research in the future. At the end of the article, we suggest a number of directions for future research.";;10.1145/3423956;https://doi.org/10.1145/3423956;;;CS0, CS1, CS1.5, CS2, CS3, Event-oriented, K–12, computer science education, event-based, programming education;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The developed solution uses a leap motion controller as hand-tracking device and embeds a supervised machine learning. The K-nearest neighbor methodology is adopted for automatically characterizing the physiotherapist or helper hand movement resulting a unique movement pattern that constitutes the basis of the rehabilitation process. In the second stage, an evaluation of the patients rehabilitation exercises results is compared to the movement pattern of the patient and results are presented, saved and statistically analyzed. Physicians and physiotherapists monitor and assess patients’ rehabilitation improvements through a web application, furthermore, offer medical assisted rehabilitation processes through low cost technology, which can be easily exploited at home. Recorded tracked motion data and results can be used for further medical study and evaluating rehabilitation trends according to patient’s rehabilitation practice and improvement.;;10.1007/s00146-019-00925-8;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-019-00925-8;;;Hand rehabilitation, K-nearest neighbor, Leap motion controller;Springer-Verlag;0951-5666;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

It is built as an environment where the speaker confronts a virtual audience that reacts in real time to the speaker's features, such as voice, gestures and bio-metric parameters (heart rate or skin conductivity, among others). The novelty of this videogame is that it is focused on the audience, since in real life, the only feedback we receive when we speak in public is that of our listeners. By their reactions we can determine if our communication is being effective. For that purpose, we included in the game a virtual audience based on agents that is able to provide feedback to the speakers in real time, so that they can react and adapt their speech accordingly.;;10.1145/3290607.3311777;https://doi.org/10.1145/3290607.3311777;;;emotion recognition, pubic speaking, software agents, virtual reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

With the coming of the high demand of virtual interaction, 360-degree Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and applications have established stronger relationships with your peers and friends if it applies. However, higher quality of VR streaming brings users deeper immersive experience which requires greater network bandwidth and latency, and more powerful computation capability for individuals. To address these issues, the proposed intelligent video delivery scheme in this paper takes advantage of the edge-assisted computational power to improve the multi-user oriented watching experience of high quality 360-degree video over wireless networks, which reduces network resource utilization, and also optimizes edge cache hit ratio and user’s Field of View (FoV) quality.;;10.1007/978-3-031-20500-2_20;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20500-2_20;;;Wireless network, Deep reinforcement learning, Edge computing, 360-degree videos;Springer-Verlag;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Multi-target 3D Reconstruction from RGB-D Data;Gao, Yang and Yao, Yuan and Jiang, Yunliang;;2019;ACM Digital Library;184–191;;The main purpose of this paper is to quickly reconstruct multiple closed three-dimensional models in a scene. In this case, a method for reconstructing objects in a scene interactively is presented. Firstly a 3D scene mesh model with color is reconstructed fromthe RGB-D data. Secondly, a semantic label system is designed to segment different types of surfaces and objects in the scene, which provides a reference for further extraction and repair of models. Finally, an adaptive hole filling algorithm is deployed to recover the original mesh models automatically. It is demonstrated that our method can scan and generate multiple models at once, and the surface quality of the scanned structure is also evaluated.;;10.1145/3339363.3339395;https://doi.org/10.1145/3339363.3339395;;;Model segmentation, Hole filling, 3D reconstruction;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Based on Superpixel Sampling Clustering Networks;Xiao, Jun-sheng and Xu, Hua-hu and Ma, Xiao-jin;;2019;ACM Digital Library;178–183;;Semantic segmentation models based on deep neural networks depend highly on a large number of pixel-level annotations, while pixel-level annotations require a lot of manpower and resources. Therefore, we propose a weakly supervised image semantic segmentation algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network. This method only the quantity image-level annotations to perform image semantic segmentation. In this paper, the non-conductible superpixel sampling algorithm SLIC is transformed into derivable by relaxing restrictions, added to the deep convolutional neural network to achieve end-to-end training, and the center of the superpixel is dynamically obtained step by step. The saliency map with semantic information is used as the seed, and the seed is used as the cluster center. Then the superpixel block is used as the basic unit when seed grows, and the dynamically generated superpixel module is clustered using the K-Means algorithm. Set the number of categories for image segmentation to the number of clusters of the K-Means algorithm. Until a steady state is reached. Finally, the segmentation results optimized by CRF algorithm to generates fined graind contour. The algorithm is tested in the open challenge data set PASCAL VOC 2012, which is superior to the existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation algorithm, the convergence speed is significantly improved, and the segmentation result is more refined.;;10.1145/3339363.3339394;https://doi.org/10.1145/3339363.3339394;;;Weakely supervision, Superpixel, Semantic segmentation, K-Means;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45357;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Quality Assessment of Online Automated Privacy Policy Generators: An Empirical Study;Sun, Ruoxi and Xue, Minhui;;2020;ACM Digital Library;270–275;;"Online Automated Privacy Policy Generators (APPGs) are tools used by app developers to quickly create app privacy policies which are required by privacy regulations to be incorporated to each mobile app. The creation of these tools brings convenience to app developers; however, the quality of these tools puts developers and stakeholders at legal risk. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to assess the quality of online APPGs. We analyze the completeness of privacy policies, determine what categories and items should be covered in a complete privacy policy, and conduct APPG assessment with boilerplate apps. The results of assessment show that due to the lack of static or dynamic analysis of app's behavior, developers may encounter two types of issues caused by APPGs. First, the generated policies could be incomplete because they do not cover all the essential items required by a privacy policy. Second, some generated privacy policies contain unnecessary personal information collection or arbitrary commitments inconsistent with user input. Ultimately, the defects of APPGs may potentially lead to serious legal issues. We hope that the results and insights developed in this paper can motivate the healthy and ethical development of APPGs towards generating a more complete, accurate, and robust privacy policy.";;10.1145/3383219.3383247;https://doi.org/10.1145/3383219.3383247;;;Quality assessment, Privacy policy completeness analysis, Automated privacy policy generator;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

The literature includes many papers related to the uses and benefits of XBRL in the areas of finance and accounting. However, there is a research gap on its benefits to software engineering. This paper seeks to identify the XBRL impacts on financial software development processes and software quality factors. Identifying such impacts may help software development companies better understand the advantages related to XBRL use and increase the adoption in other companies.

;An extended reality approach for creating immersive software project workspaces;Sharma, Vibhu Saujanya and Mehra, Rohit and Kaulgud, Vikrant and Podder, Sanjay;;2019;ACM Digital Library;27–30;;Software project workspaces are areas of constant project activities across different phases of the software development lifecycle. Besides being physical spaces to house the team members these are also areas of teamwork, creativity and collaboration. It is well established that there are several information and insight needs of software teams (both individual and collective) during the course of any project. Interestingly, the use of the project workspaces themselves for assisting in getting those insights has been almost non-existent and there is little technological support for doing so. Here we present our approach that utilizes advances in extended reality to augment the software project bay with important insights which are anchored on and around real objects in the workspace. The approach is based upon mining the data exhaust (disparate sources of data and logs) of the software project and development environment, for data important to construct insights relevant to an XR headset wearer and the team. The wearer's location and parts of the workspace (floors, furniture, ceilings) are detected in the wearer's field of view and thereon spatial mapping is utilized to overlay important representations of the relevant insights onto/around them. The immersive insights are contextual, can be continuously updated and leverage affordances of human perception, for better comprehension, enhanced creativity as well as recall. Along with our approach, we also present an early Microsoft Hololens based implementation which allows for different categories of live augmentations for creating a smart immersive workspace.;;10.1109/CHASE.2019.00013;https://doi.org/10.1109/CHASE.2019.00013;;;software delivery, project workspaces, immersive experiences, extended reality;IEEE Press;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Gesture Knitter: A Hand Gesture Design Tool for Head-Mounted Mixed Reality Applications;Mo, George B. and Dudley, John J and Kristensson, Per Ola;;2021;ACM Digital Library;;;Hand gestures are a natural and expressive input method enabled by modern mixed reality headsets. However, it remains challenging for developers to create custom gestures for their applications. Conventional strategies to bespoke gesture recognition involve either hand-crafting or data-intensive deep-learning. Neither approach is well suited for rapid prototyping of new interactions. This paper introduces a flexible and efficient alternative approach for constructing hand gestures. We present Gesture Knitter: a design tool for creating custom gesture recognizers with minimal training data. Gesture Knitter allows the specification of gesture primitives that can then be combined to create more complex gestures using a visual declarative script. Designers can build custom recognizers by declaring them from scratch or by providing a demonstration that is automatically decoded into its primitive components. Our developer study shows that Gesture Knitter achieves high recognition accuracy despite minimal training data and delivers an expressive and creative design experience.;;10.1145/3411764.3445766;https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445766;;;virtual reality, gestures, augmented reality;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;MO-DM Tool: Improving teams’ engagement with Motivation-Oriented Decision-Making;Neto, Alvaro Magnum Barbosa and Carvalho, Emmanuel and Bandeira, Marc\'{\i}Lio;;2022;ACM Digital Library;88–94;;A significant part of Software Engineering students’ academic and professional life involves working on projects in collaboration with their peers. They will form teams and perform on many software-related projects. Studies based on a systematic literature review and experimental results in a multidisciplinary tech-based innovation course with undergraduate students from Computer Engineering and Computer Science indicate difficulties in two significant activities in collaborative work: decision-making and reaching consensus. These recurrent difficulties negatively affect learners’ motivation and engagement throughout the project’s life cycle, besides other losses. This article aims to present a tool based on a model called MO-DM (Motivation-Oriented Decision-Making) proposed in doctoral research to address these hardships. It enables a new project view of members’ motivation and engagement, considering all the choices made along the project journey. The tool is grounded on EVC (Expectancy-Value-Cost) model, using it in a new way. Decisions like ”What programming language should we use?” are observed from the perspective of ”Which programming language can bring more engagement and motivation to the majority of the team?”. This view makes it possible to identify which students are more susceptible to being demotivated and disengaged in each step, and actions can be performed to mitigate these effects. Teams can make more engaging and motivating choices by picking the ones that will positively affect most of the group, enhancing the chances of successful projects. MO-DM tool is under preliminary tests with satisfactory results. Many decision-making situations where motivation and engagement are concerns can benefit from MO-DM.

;Cinemacraft: exploring fidelity cues in collaborative virtual world interactions;Narayanan, Siddharth and Polys, Nicholas and Bukvic, Ivica Ico;Virtual Real.;2020;ACM Digital Library;53–73;24;The research presented in this paper explores the contribution of avatar fidelity to social interaction in virtual environments and how sensory fusion can improve these interactions. Specifically, we vary levels of interaction fidelity to investigate how responsiveness and behavioural realism affect people’s experience of interacting with virtual humans. This is accomplished through the creation of Cinemacraft, a technology-mediated immersive platform for collaborative human–computer interaction. Cinemacraft leverages a voxel game engine similar to Minecraft to facilitate collaborative interaction in a virtual 3D world and incorporates sensory fusion to improve the fidelity of real-time collaboration. The primary hypothesis of the study is that embodied interactions result in a higher degree of presence, and that sensory fusion can improve the quality of presence and co-presence. We tested our hypothesis through a user-study of 24 participants. Based on suggestions from existing literature, we sidestep the uncanny valley effect through the use of low fidelity avatars (a la Minecraft) and identify cues that impact users ratings of presence, co-presence and successful collaboration. The findings and ensuing data in this research can be applied to produce a more compelling platform for live collaborative interactions, performances, and empathetic storytelling. This research contributes to the field of immersive, collaborative interaction by making transparent the platform, methodology, instruments and code accessible for team members with less technological expertise, as well as developers aspiring to use interactive 3D media to promote further experimentation and conceptual discussions.;;10.1007/s10055-019-00382-0;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10055-019-00382-0;;;Motion capture, Computing methodologies, Virtual worlds software, Software engineering, Information systems;Springer-Verlag;1359-4338;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Fostering the Innovative Mindset: Entrepreneurship Clinic Model for Computer Science Students;Rusu, Adrian and Rusu, Amalia;;2023;ACM Digital Library;464–470;;Graduates distinguish themselves by being creative, innovative, and showing leadership, but such instructional topics are usually formally emphasized in business curricula. Computer Science students could minor in entrepreneurship or other business-related fields in order to foster their innovative mindset and obtain a business acumen that complements the technical expertise they obtain in their majors, but such minors usually require at least five additional courses. We discuss the formal incorporation of entrepreneurship in the computer science curriculum as part of a clinic model that includes real-world experiences, at the expense of two 1-credit hands-on clinics that can be embedded into the number of credits required for the computer science degree.After experimenting with various models and activities over a period of several years, we present our current iteration that was successfully deployed for the past four years as a course framework that combines both entrepreneurial and technical aspects into a two-semester software engineering course sequence with assigned clinic experience during the junior year. Students learn how to find and evaluate ideas, build rapid prototypes, test hypotheses, use different types of business models and financial analysis, market their software products, and understand how to start a business. Students are able to pitch and refine their ideas with various audiences and compete in entrepreneurship competitions. From dreaming ideas to creating and managing teams, computer science students are guided through the process by faculty, entrepreneurs, and potential investors.

;Next Generation E-Learning System: University Network Migration to Complete Wireless State;Usmanov, Maxim and Stepanenko, Alexander and Matvienko, Elena and Ponomarev, Andrey and Proletarskiy, Andrey;;2021;ACM Digital Library;229–235;;In educational institutions, we are faced with the fact that when planning a campus network, we have to take into account constant changes not only in the technologies for providing access to the network, but also in the devices themselves that connect to the network of the educational institution. Every new year, students arrive with more and more modern models of laptops, smartphones and it is not always convenient for them to use the devices provided by the institution. Even modern devices are already striving for compactness and lightness, which reduces the number of connectors in them, and the size of the Ethernet port does not at all contribute to the compactness of the device. Moving to a wireless network, we provide more flexibility and do not get tied to the end devices.Modern trends in educational technologies dictate new requirements for bandwidth and latency within the network. Given the traffic of services being currently deployed in educational institutions, their network needs to be reconfigured to meet these new requirements.Fortunately, the devices and technologies responsible for providing network access are also moving forward and are constantly being updated and developed.In the first part of this paper, the authors analyze the weaknesses of the existing university communications network. The main characteristics that will be analyzed in this part will be presented both by classical bandwidth and more complex topics such as network monitoring and security.One of the vectors of the development of modern science is the Wi-Fi 6 technology, also known as IEEE 802.11ax, which would be a subject of the second part of this article. This standard's important advantage is the increase of data transfer rate that could be achieved by using the technologies of OFDMA modulation and MU-MIMO, which makes it possible to increase the number of possible connections. This is required due to significant increase of students and teachers and therefore devices. It provides the opportunities for convenient work with the IoT, because of built-in specific functions. In addition, Wi-Fi 6 provides low latency, which is necessary for effective work with virtual and augmented reality applications. This is important due to common implementation of these topics into educational programs.It should be noted that the presented article uses the data collected in BMSTU during the pilot project on implementation of Wi-Fi 6 as the only technology to connect end users.;;10.1145/3451471.3451507;https://doi.org/10.1145/3451471.3451507;;;Wireless Networks, Wi-Fi 6, WLAN, OFDMA, MU-MIMO, E-Learning;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Moreover, it is the first network-parameterized model to naturally extend to 3D settings, enabling high-quality 3D computer-generated holography using a novel phase regularization strategy of the complex-valued wave field.

;Creating a Post-sedentary Work Context for Software Engineering;Hedlund, Martin and Bogdan, Cristian and Meixner, Gerrit;;2021;ACM Digital Library;123–138;;Software engineers are sedentary and need technological help for a more healthy life. Current software engineering tasks are mostly confined to the standard sedentary desktop user interface. We believe that software engineering should be restructured so that it offers a non-sedentary alternative. In this paper, we describe a new research approach, called Post-sedentary Software Engineering. Our ambition with this approach is to provide an alternative, healthier work context without decreasing productivity. We take a spatial approach to post-sedentary tool design, starting from the assumption an interactive 3D environment with appropriate metaphors is necessary for full body movement. We discuss available technologies for achieving this goal and outline four studies that incorporate the software engineering phases of code comprehension, code creation and debugging in a non-sedentary context.;;10.1007/978-3-030-98388-8_12;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98388-8_12;;;Software engineering, Metaphor, Spatial, Post-sedentary, Sedentary;Springer-Verlag;;;;Envolve o ensino de Engenharia de Software, mas não aborda o uso da Realidade Aumentada;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;ZeusAR: a process and an architecture to automate the development of augmented reality serious games;Mar\'{\i}n-Vega, Humberto and Alor-Hern\'{a}ndez, Giner and Colombo-Mendoza, Luis Omar and Bustos-L\'{o}pez, Maritza and Zatara\'{\i}n-Cabada, Ram\'{o}n;Multimedia Tools Appl.;2022;ACM Digital Library;2901–2935;81;A software development process comprises all the steps necessary to produce a software product. This research proposes a new process for developing augmented reality serious games (ARSGs), which comprises three phases: analysis, configuration, and generation. The analysis phase involves examining the standard project structure of a typical serious game to identify the applicable actions to which AR content can be added. The configuration phase involves configuring the AR features and the AR library to be integrated into the game structure. Finally, the generation phase entails inserting the AR code in the game structure, as well as all the files necessary to in-corporate AR features in the game. Our process allows generating ARSGs step by step, both easily and rapidly. To implement this process, we propose an ARSG development software architecture. The underlying assumption of this architecture is that software development tools are essential validation elements of the software generation process. By implementing our ARSG development process through a software architecture, we provide users with a formal, automated method for creating ARSGs. The ARSG development process and the architecture, collectively called ZeusAR, are not dependent on specific software development technologies and/or programming languages. To perform a proof-of-concept of our process, we developed an ARSG generator tool based on the proposed architecture and conducted a case study in which geometry ARSGs are developed to help high school students learn about geometric shapes and their properties. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the ZeusAR tool through a System-Usability-Scale (SUS) based survey, which was administered to a group of geometry teachers to evaluate the tool’s characteristics, such as ease of use and ease of configuration. Additionally, a group of software developers and professors assessed the performance of the ZeusAR tool in terms of game development time.;;10.1007/s11042-021-11695-1;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-11695-1;;;Software process, Augmented reality serious game;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1380-7501;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;Visualizing and Interacting with Hierarchical Menus in Immersive Augmented Reality;Pourmemar, Majid and Poullis, Charalambos;;2019;ACM Digital Library;;;Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have long been used as a way to inform the user of the large number of available actions and options. GUIs in desktop applications traditionally appear in the form of two-dimensional hierarchical menus due to the limited screen real estate, the spatial restrictions imposed by the hardware e.g. 2D, and the available input modalities e.g. mouse/keyboard point-and-click, touch, dwell-time etc. In immersive Augmented Reality (AR), there are no such restrictions and the available input modalities are different (i.e. hand gestures, head pointing or voice recognition), yet the majority of the applications in AR still use the same type of GUIs as with desktop applications. In this paper we focus on identifying the most efficient combination of (hierarchical menu type, input modality) to use in immersive applications using AR headsets. We report on the results of a within-subjects study with 25 participants who performed a number of tasks using four combinations of the most popular hierarchical menu types with the most popular input modalities in AR, namely: (drop-down menu, hand gestures), (drop-down menu, voice), (radial menu, hand gestures), and (radial menu, head pointing). Results show that the majority of the participants (60%, 15) achieved a faster performance using the hierarchical radial menu with head pointing control. Furthermore, the participants clearly indicated the radial menu with head pointing control as the most preferred interaction technique due to the limited physical demand as opposed to the current de facto interaction technique in AR i.e. hand gestures, which after prolonged use becomes physically demanding leading to arm fatigue known as ’Gorilla arms’.;;10.1145/3359997.3365693;https://doi.org/10.1145/3359997.3365693;;;Interaction techniques, Interaction paradigms, Head Pointing, Graphical user interfaces, Gestural input;Association for Computing Machinery;;;;The paper is related to the use of AR in the context of teaching Software Engineering;45350;45418;annazenaide;annazenaide;Accepted;

Augmented reality could be used to visualize the wealth of user-generated content available on social media and enable context-adaptive functions for emergency operators. Although emergency operators agree that social media analytics will be important for their future work, it poses a challenge to filter and visualize large amounts of social media data. We conducted a goal-directed task analysis to identify the situation awareness requirements of emergency operators. By collecting tweets during two storms in Germany we evaluated the usefulness of Twitter data for achieving situation awareness and conducted interviews with emergency operators to derive filter strategies for social media data. We synthesized the results by discussing how the unique interface of augmented reality can be used to integrate social media data into emergency control rooms for situation awareness support.;;10.1007/s10796-020-10101-9;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-020-10101-9;;;Social media analytics, Augmented reality, Emergency control rooms, Emergency management, Situation awareness;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1387-3326;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

To achieve this goal, a one-group pre-test, and post-test design was used to assess the effect of using AR-supported educational toys on pre-school children's learning of English words/concepts and retention levels. The case study method was used to investigate the children's perspectives of their AR learning experiences. The sample of this study consisted of 39 pre-school children aged between 5-6. Firstly, the word/concept test was conducted as a pre-test. After 4 weeks of implementation, the test was applied as a post-test. Two weeks after the implementations were completed, the same test was conducted again, and the retention level of the children was determined. Then, face-to-face interviews were done with six children within the week after the final tests. Results showed that there was a 72-point increase in their word/concept learning after the implementation. The children dropped 17 points in the retention test after a two-week break following the post-test. It was found that the children correctly answered 93% of the words saying the English versions of the visual and 55% of the words saying the English equivalents of the words. In addition, the children remembered 77% of the English version of the words shown in the visual and 50% of the English equivalents of the words. Qualitative results indicated that children liked AR materials in general and that it had a positive effect on their learning.;;10.1007/s10639-022-10916-w;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-10916-w;;;English Language Learning, Early years education, Augmented reality;Kluwer Academic Publishers;1360-2357;;;Use of AR unrelated to the teaching of Software Engineering;45350;45353;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Situated visualization (SV) allows presenting visual data representations in context and may support better DSS. Its main characteristic is to display data representations near the data referent. As augmented reality (AR) is becoming more mature, affordable, and widespread, using it as a tool for SV becomes viable in several situations. Moreover, it may provide a positive contribution to more effective and efficient decision-making, as the users have contextual, relevant, and appropriate information that fosters more informed choices. As new challenges and opportunities arise, it is important to understand the relevance of intertwining these fields. Based on literature analysis, this paper introduces the main concepts involved, and, through practical examples, addresses and discusses current areas of application, benefits, challenges, and opportunities of using SV through AR to visualize data in context to support better decision-making processes.

As there are no reliable methods for training spatial ability, this makes it a difficult skill to improve. This paper presents two spatial ability trainer apps exploring the latest mobile technologies: augmented reality and virtual reality. The workflow in these applications incorporates scaffolding support and repetition to provide learners with the opportunity to apply newly acquired knowledge. A sample of 50 participants studying engineering were included in the evaluation, with the results showing that participants benefited in both skill and confidence from training in only a short period of time. Participants with weak incoming spatial ability particularly benefited. These findings show the promising potential of augmented reality and virtual reality in improving spatial ability.

Since, variety of applications are being developed using this IoT paradigm, there is an immense necessity for storing data, processing them to get meaningful information and render suitable services to the end-users. The “thing” in this decade is not only a smart sensor or a device; it can be any physical or household object, a smart device or a mobile. With the ever increasing rise in population and smart device usage in every sphere of life, when all of such “thing”s generates data, there is a chance of huge data traffic in the internet. This could be handled only by integrating “Internet of Everything (IoE)” paradigm with a completely diversified technology — Cloud Computing. In order to handle this heavy flow of data traffic and process the same to generate meaningful information, various services in the global environment are utilized. Hence the primary focus revolves in integrating these two diversified paradigm shifts to develop intelligent information processing systems. Energy Efficient Cloud Based Internet of Everything (EECloudIoE) architecture is proposed in this study, which acts as an initial step in integrating these two wide areas thereby providing valuable services to the end users. The utilization of energy is optimized by clustering the various IoT network using Wind Driven Optimization Algorithm. Next, an optimized Cluster Head (CH) is chosen for each cluster, using Firefly Algorithm resulting in reduced data traffic in comparison to other non-clustering schemes. The proposed clustering of IoE is further compared with the widely used state of the art techniques like Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adaptive Gravitational Search algorithm (AGSA). The results justify the superiority of the proposed methodology outperforming the existing approaches with an increased life-time and reduction in traffic.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.02.010;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731520300356;;;Green communication, Energy cloud, Internet of everything (IoE), Wind driven algorithm, Firefly algorithm;;0743-7315;;;;45350;45350;annazenaide;;Duplicated;

;Multi-tasking Federated Learning meets Blockchain to Foster Trust and Security in the Metaverse;Hajar Moudoud and Soumaya Cherkaoui;Ad Hoc Networks;2023;Science@Direct;103264;150;The Metaverse is a term that refers to a shared virtual space where users can interact with each other and with a virtual environment in real-time. The Metaverse has gained a lot of attention in recent years owing to the accelerated advancements in virtual and augmented realty technologies, which made it possible to create more immersive and highly interactive experiences for users. However, as users engage with the Metaverse, they generate a lot of data, which may include their location, activity, and interactions with other users. This data can be used to train multiple machine learning (ML) models to personalize content and ads, but it can also be exploited for more nefarious uses. The problem of user data collection and the sharing of sensitive and private data in the Metaverse is a challenge. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) mechanism that can avoid problems related to data sharing by having multiple devices work together to create a ML model while maintaining their local training data private. The utilization of FL in the Metaverse involves numerous contributors, thereby increasing the susceptibility to malicious activity, including attacks. To address this issue, a promising solution is the integration of blockchain technology, which can provide a trusted solution to the metaverse that allows for secure model learning. Due to frequent communication between FL and blockchain, FL needs to be adapted to the limited communication bandwidth and limited resources of the device. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based FL framework to enhance security and trustworthiness in the Metaverse. The proposed solution utilizes a multi-task FL approach that leverages blockchain sharding to enhance the system’s throughput while simultaneously reducing resource requirements. By breaking the blockchain network into smaller shards, the processing power required for each shard is reduced, leading to an increase in overall throughput. The multi-task FL approach allows for the simultaneous training of multiple ML models, reducing the time and resources required to train each model individually. We formulate the model learning problem into a blockchain sharding problem and propose a bipartite matching solution for shard creation. Furthermore, we propose a scheduling approach to distribute the bandwidth between reliable devices, hence minimizing communication across FL devices and giving devices with a reliable behavior and informative dataset priority. Numerical results demonstrated that our framework has better performance than referenced solutions on the selected indicators.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103264;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870523001841;;;Metaverse, Federated learning, Blockchain, Device scheduling, Security;;1570-8705;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;
;The future of the technology-based manufacturing in the European Union;Awadesh Kumar Mallik;Results in Engineering;2023;Science@Direct;101356;19;The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.;;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2023.101356;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590123023004838;;;Manufacturing, EU, Carbon-neutrality, Digitalization, Management;;2590-1230;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45356;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

Although there are many good examples of AR technology being used in engineering, retail, and for entertainment, the technology has not been widely adopted for teaching in university engineering departments. It is generally accepted that the use of AR can complement the students’ learning experience by improving engagement and by helping to visualise complex engineering physics; however, several key challenges still have to be addressed to fully integrate the use of AR into a broader engineering curriculum. The presented paper reviews the uses of AR in engineering education, highlights the benefits of AR integration in engineering curriculums, as well as the barriers that are preventing its wider adoption.";;;;;;;MDPI;;;;Outras revisões/mapeamentos;45391;45398;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;Mixed Reality Piano Tutor: A Gamified Piano Practice Environment;Molloy, Will and Huang, Edward and Wünsche, Burkhard C.;;2019;IEEE Digital Library;1-7;;Learning to play piano has many benefits ranging from relieving stress to stimulating neural connections and language skills. However, the learning process is difficult and a lack of intrinsic motivation results in a high drop-out rate of novice piano students. Gamification has been proposed as a technique to overcome lack of intrinsic motivation, and has been successfully applied in education and health. In this paper we present a novel gamification technique for piano tutoring. The method is integrated with an AR approach in order to reduce cognitive load, and a continuous feedback system, to make the learning process less strenuous and more motivating. Our results show that users consider the system intuitive, interesting, and fun, and that users had a greater note playing accuracy than with Synthesia, a popular commercial piano learning system.;;10.23919/ELINFOCOM.2019.8706474;;;;"Games;Keyboards;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality;Visualization;Tools;Rhythm;piano learning;piano tutor;augmented reality;gamification;visual feedback";;;;;"We can’t access the paper or the paper refers to only to an abstract ";45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Rejected;

;The use of smart glasses in nursing education: A scoping review;Charlotte Romare and Lisa Skär;Nurse Education in Practice;2023;Science@Direct;103824;73;"Aim
The aim of this scoping review was to give an overview of the usability and feasibility of smart glasses in nursing education. In addition, this study will highlight nursing students’ experiences of using smart glasses in learning situations.
Background
Healthcare is becoming increasingly complex and technological and so is nursing education. Technology enhanced learning aims to enhance the teaching-learning process through use of technology, for example through smart glasses.
Design and methods
A literature review using a scoping review methodology was conducted. Qualitative content analysis was performed to analyse data. 14 references were included in the analysis. References were found using the databases PubMed, SCOPUS and ERIC.
Results
The analysis resulted in three categories; (1) Situations in which smart glasses have been used in nursing education, (2) Learning experiences from using smart glasses in nursing education, and (3) User experiences from using smart glasses in nursing education. Smart glasses were used in different learning situations and were in general positively evaluated by nursing students. Although, drawbacks of using smart glasses were noted which could negatively effect student learning.
Conclusions
Smart glasses have been used in a variety of learning situations in nursing education and enabled new learning situations. Students found smart glasses beneficial for their learning and smart glasses motivated and engaged students in the learning situation. Although, this was both user- and situation dependent. Technical issues could cause students to lose focus and there is need for technical support to facilitate the learning curve. By learning from others’ experiences unnecessary drawbacks can be avoided.";;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2023.103824;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147159532300286X;;;Education, Learning, Scoping review, Smart Glasses, Students, Nursing;;1471-5953;;;;45350;45456;annazenaide;annazenaide;Duplicated;
